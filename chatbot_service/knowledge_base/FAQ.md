## Basic TB Information

### What is TB?
**A:** Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). The bacteria, or germs, usually affect the lungs. TB germs can affect any part of the body, such as the kidneys, spine, or brain.

### How is TB spread?
**A:** TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are spread into the air when a person with infectious TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. People nearby may breathe in these TB germs and become infected. When a person breathes in TB germs, the TB germs can settle in the lungs and begin to grow. From there, the TB germs can move through the blood to other parts of the body, such as the kidney, spine, or brain.

### What is latent TB infection (LTBI)?
**A:** Latent TB infection occurs when TB germs are in your body but are not active. People with latent TB infection do not feel sick, do not have symptoms, and cannot spread TB to others. However, without treatment, latent TB infection can progress to TB disease.

### What are the symptoms of TB disease?
**A:** Symptoms of TB disease depend on where in the body the TB germs are growing. TB disease in the lungs may cause:
- **Cough** (lasting longer than 3 weeks)
- **Coughing up blood or sputum** (phlegm from inside the lungs)
- **Chest pain**
- **Fever**
- **Night sweats**
- **Chills**
- **Loss of appetite**
- **Weakness or fatigue**
- **Weight loss**

Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body may include:
- **TB of the kidney:** Blood in the urine
- **TB meningitis:** Headache or confusion
- **TB of the spine:** Back pain
- **TB of the larynx:** Hoarseness

### What if I have a positive test for TB infection?
**A:** If you have a positive reaction to the TB blood test or TB skin test, your doctor or nurse will do other tests to see if you have TB disease. These tests usually include a chest X-ray. They may also include a test of the sputum you cough up. Because TB germs may be found somewhere other than your lungs, your doctor or nurse may check your urine, take tissue samples, or do other tests. Without treatment, latent TB infection (LTBI) can progress to TB disease.

## Diagnosis and Testing

### How is TB diagnosed?
**A:** TB is diagnosed through a combination of:
- **Medical history** and physical examination
- **TB skin test (TST)** or **blood test (IGRA)**
- **Chest X-ray**
- **Sputum tests** (smear and culture)
- **Rapid molecular tests** (GeneXpert MTB/RIF)

### What is the difference between a TB skin test and TB blood test?
**A:** Both tests can determine if you have been infected with TB germs:
- **TB skin test (TST):** A small amount of testing material is injected under the skin, and results are read 48-72 hours later
- **TB blood test (IGRA):** Blood is drawn and tested in a laboratory, with results available in 1-3 days
- **Both tests:** May give positive results in people who have been vaccinated with BCG

### How long does it take to get TB test results?
**A:** 
- **TB skin test:** 48-72 hours
- **TB blood test:** 1-3 days
- **Chest X-ray:** Same day
- **Sputum smear:** Same day to 2 days
- **Sputum culture:** 2-8 weeks
- **GeneXpert:** 2 hours

## Treatment

### Is TB curable?
**A:** Yes, TB is curable and preventable. With proper treatment, people with TB can be completely cured. It's important to take all medications exactly as prescribed and complete the full course of treatment.

### How long does TB treatment take?
**A:** 
- **Active TB disease:** Usually 4-6 months
- **Latent TB infection:** 3-9 months depending on the treatment regimen
- **Drug-resistant TB:** 18-24 months or longer

### What happens if I don't complete my TB treatment?
**A:** If you don't finish your treatment:
- **TB may not be cured** and can become active again
- **You may remain infectious** and spread TB to others
- **TB germs may become resistant** to the medicines
- **Treatment becomes more difficult** and expensive

### Can I get TB more than once?
**A:** Yes, you can get TB infection again after being successfully treated. This is more likely if:
- You have HIV or other conditions that weaken your immune system
- You are exposed to someone with drug-resistant TB
- You live in an area with high TB rates

## Side Effects and Safety

### What are common side effects of TB medications?
**A:** Most people tolerate TB medicines well, but some may experience:
- **Minor side effects:** Upset stomach, skin rash, orange-colored urine/tears
- **Serious side effects:** Liver problems (yellowing of skin/eyes), vision changes, hearing problems
- **Report any side effects** to your healthcare provider immediately

### Can I drink alcohol while taking TB medications?
**A:** No, you should avoid alcohol while taking TB medications. Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage and reduce the effectiveness of treatment.

### Is it safe to take TB medications during pregnancy?
**A:** Yes, most TB medications are safe during pregnancy. It's important to treat TB during pregnancy to protect both mother and baby. Some medications may be avoided, but effective treatment options exist.

## Transmission and Prevention

### How long am I contagious if I have TB disease?
**A:** People with TB disease of the lungs or throat are usually contagious until they have:
- Been on appropriate treatment for **2-3 weeks**
- Shown improvement in symptoms
- Had three negative sputum smear tests

### Can I go to work or school with TB?
**A:** 
- **Latent TB:** Yes, you can continue normal activities
- **Active TB:** You should stay home until no longer infectious (usually 2-3 weeks after starting treatment)
- **Follow your doctor's advice** about when it's safe to return

### How can I prevent spreading TB to my family?
**A:** 
- **Take your medications** as prescribed
- **Cover your mouth** when coughing or sneezing
- **Ensure good ventilation** in your home
- **Wear a mask** when around others until no longer infectious
- **Get family members tested** for TB

### Who should get tested for TB?
**A:** People who should get tested include:
- **Close contacts** of someone with TB disease
- **People with HIV** or other immune system problems
- **People from countries** with high TB rates
- **Healthcare workers**
- **People living in group settings** (prisons, shelters, nursing homes)

## Special Populations

### Can children get TB?
**A:** Yes, children can get TB. Symptoms in children may include:
- Poor growth or weight loss
- Fever lasting more than one week
- Persistent cough
- Difficulty feeding (in infants)

### Is TB different in people with HIV?
**A:** TB is more serious in people with HIV:
- **HIV increases risk** of developing active TB disease
- **TB can occur anywhere** in the body (not just lungs)
- **Symptoms may be different** or less obvious
- **Treatment requires coordination** between TB and HIV care

### Can elderly people get TB?
**A:** Yes, elderly people are at higher risk for TB because:
- **Immune systems weaken** with age
- **Many were infected** when TB was more common
- **Symptoms may be less obvious**
- **Other health conditions** can complicate treatment

## Drug-Resistant TB

### What is drug-resistant TB?
**A:** Drug-resistant TB occurs when TB germs develop the ability to survive despite anti-TB drugs. Types include:
- **MDR-TB:** Resistant to isoniazid and rifampin
- **XDR-TB:** Resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones, and injectable drugs

### How does drug resistance develop?
**A:** Drug resistance develops when:
- **Patients don't complete** their full treatment
- **Healthcare providers prescribe** wrong medications or doses
- **Poor quality medications** are used
- **Drug supply is interrupted**

### Is drug-resistant TB treatable?
**A:** Yes, but it's more difficult:
- **Treatment takes longer** (18-24 months)
- **Medications are more expensive** and have more side effects
- **Success rates are lower** than drug-sensitive TB
- **Requires specialist care**
