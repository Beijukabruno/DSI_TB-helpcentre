# Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) Information

*Sources: [WHO TB Fact Sheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis), [WHO Global TB Report 2024](https://www.who.int/publications/digital/global-tuberculosis-report-2024)*

## Overview

Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely.

**MDR-TB** is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and toxic.

## Types of Drug-Resistant TB

### 1. Rifampicin-Resistant TB (RR-TB)
• **Definition:** TB resistant to rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs)
• **Includes:** All MDR-TB cases
• **Testing:** Detected by rapid molecular tests like Xpert MTB/RIF
• **Treatment:** Requires second-line drugs

### 2. Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB)
• **Definition:** TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
• **Most serious form** of drug-resistant TB
• **Treatment duration:** 18-24 months traditionally
• **Success rate:** Lower than drug-sensitive TB

### 3. Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB)
• **Definition:** MDR-TB plus resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs
• **Very limited treatment options**
• **Poorest outcomes** among all TB types
• **Requires specialist management**

### 4. Totally Drug-Resistant TB (TDR-TB)
• **Definition:** Resistant to all tested first-line and second-line drugs
• **Extremely rare** but documented in some countries
• **Very poor prognosis**
• **Requires experimental treatments**

## Global Burden

### 2023 Statistics:
• **410,000 people** developed rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB)
• **5,646 people** started on BPaLM/BPaL regimen (up from 1,744 in 2022)
• **Treatment success rate:** 66% for MDR/RR-TB (compared to 86% for drug-sensitive TB)

### Geographic Distribution:
• **Highest burden countries:** India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, South Africa
• **WHO European Region:** Highest proportion of MDR-TB among new cases
• **Eastern Europe and Central Asia:** Particularly high MDR-TB rates

## Causes of Drug Resistance

### Primary Resistance:
• **Infected with resistant strain** from another person
• **More common** in high MDR-TB burden areas
• **Difficult to prevent** without proper infection control

### Acquired Resistance:
• **Develops during treatment** of drug-sensitive TB
• **Caused by:**
  - Incorrect treatment regimens
  - Poor quality medicines
  - Treatment interruption
  - Non-adherence to treatment
  - Malabsorption of drugs

### Healthcare System Factors:
• **Inadequate diagnostic capacity**
• **Delayed drug susceptibility testing**
• **Stock-outs of quality drugs**
• **Lack of treatment monitoring**
• **Poor infection control**

## New Treatment Options (2022)

### BPaLM/BPaL Regimen:
• **Duration:** 6 months (much shorter than traditional 18-24 months)
• **All-oral:** No injectable drugs required
• **Medications:**
  - **B**edaquiline
  - **P**retomanid
  - **L**inezolid
  - **M**oxifloxacin (in BPaLM)

### Advantages:
• **Shorter treatment duration**
• **Better tolerability**
• **Higher treatment success rates**
• **Fewer side effects**
• **Improved quality of life**

### Eligibility Criteria:
• Confirmed pulmonary RR/MDR-TB
• No resistance to fluoroquinolones
• No severe renal or hepatic impairment
• Not pregnant or breastfeeding

## Traditional MDR-TB Treatment

### Medications Used:
• **Second-line drugs:**
  - Fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin)
  - Injectable agents (amikacin, capreomycin)
  - Other oral agents (ethionamide, cycloserine)

### Treatment Phases:

#### Intensive Phase (8 months):
• **All medications** taken daily
• **Monthly monitoring** required
• **Injectable drugs** given daily
• **Hospitalization** often required initially

#### Continuation Phase (12-16 months):
• **Oral medications** continued
• **Injectable drugs** discontinued
• **Outpatient treatment** possible
• **Regular monitoring** continues

## Challenges in MDR-TB Treatment

### Medical Challenges:
• **Complex drug regimens**
• **Severe side effects**
• **Long treatment duration**
• **Drug interactions**
• **High cost of treatment**

### Common Side Effects:
• **Hearing loss** (from injectable drugs)
• **Kidney problems**
• **Liver toxicity**
• **Psychiatric symptoms** (depression, psychosis)
• **Gastrointestinal problems**
• **Skin reactions**

### Social and Economic Challenges:
• **Catastrophic costs** for families
• **Loss of income** during treatment
• **Social stigma**
• **Family disruption**
• **Treatment fatigue**

## Prevention of Drug Resistance

### Healthcare System Level:
• **Proper diagnosis** with drug susceptibility testing
• **Appropriate treatment regimens**
• **Quality-assured drugs**
• **Treatment monitoring**
• **Infection control measures**

### Patient Level:
• **Complete treatment** as prescribed
• **Never stop medications early**
• **Take all medications together**
• **Keep all appointments**
• **Report side effects immediately**

### Community Level:
• **Contact tracing** and testing
• **Active case finding**
• **Health education**
• **Reduce transmission**

## Treatment Monitoring

### Regular Assessments:
• **Monthly clinical evaluation**
• **Laboratory monitoring:**
  - Liver function tests
  - Kidney function tests
  - Hearing tests (audiometry)
  - Visual tests (if ethambutol used)

### Treatment Response:
• **Sputum culture conversion** (goal: within 6 months)
• **Clinical improvement**
• **Radiological improvement**
• **Weight gain**

### Contact Management:
• **Screen all household contacts**
• **Test for drug resistance**
• **Provide preventive treatment** if appropriate
• **Follow up regularly**

## Treatment Outcomes

### Success Rates:
• **Drug-sensitive TB:** 86% success rate
• **MDR/RR-TB:** 66% success rate
• **XDR-TB:** ~50% success rate

### Factors Affecting Success:
• **Early diagnosis**
• **Appropriate treatment regimen**
• **Treatment adherence**
• **Nutritional status**
• **HIV status**
• **Social support**

## Special Populations

### Children with MDR-TB:
• **Similar principles** as adults
• **Weight-based dosing**
• **Child-friendly formulations** needed
• **Family-centered care**

### Pregnant Women:
• **Avoid certain drugs** (ethionamide, aminoglycosides)
• **Safe alternatives** available
• **Close monitoring** required
• **Specialized care** needed

### HIV Co-infection:
• **Higher mortality risk**
• **Drug interactions** with ART
• **Immune reconstitution** syndrome
• **Requires specialist management**
