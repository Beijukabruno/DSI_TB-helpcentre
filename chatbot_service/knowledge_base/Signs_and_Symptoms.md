## Overview

TB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Some people with TB disease do not have any symptoms.

**Important:** Babies and children are at higher risk of developing TB disease after infection.

## Common Symptoms of Pulmonary TB

The most common form of TB affects the lungs (pulmonary TB):

• **Prolonged cough** (lasting 3 weeks or more, sometimes with blood)
• **Chest pain** 
• **Weakness**
• **Fatigue**
• **Weight loss** (unexplained)
• **Fever**
• **Night sweats**
• **Loss of appetite**

## Extrapulmonary TB Symptoms

TB can affect other parts of the body besides the lungs:

### TB of the Brain/Central Nervous System:
• Severe headaches
• Neck stiffness
• Confusion or altered mental state
• Seizures
• Nausea and vomiting

### TB of the Kidneys:
• Blood in urine
• Painful urination
• Back pain
• Frequent urination

### TB of the Spine:
• Back pain
• Stiffness
• Difficulty walking
• Neurological symptoms

### TB of the Skin:
• Skin lesions
• Slow-healing wounds
• Nodules or bumps

## TB Infection vs. TB Disease

### TB Infection (Latent TB):
• **No symptoms**
• **Not contagious**
• **Cannot spread TB** to others
• **Positive TB test** but chest X-ray is normal
• May develop into TB disease if not treated

### TB Disease (Active TB):
• **Has symptoms** (listed above)
• **Contagious** if affecting the lungs or throat
• **Can spread TB** to others through coughing, sneezing, or talking
• **Positive TB test** and abnormal chest X-ray or other tests

## When to Seek Medical Attention

**Seek immediate medical care if you have:**
• Cough lasting 3 weeks or more
• Coughing up blood
• Unexplained weight loss
• Fever and night sweats
• Persistent fatigue and weakness

**Emergency symptoms requiring immediate attention:**
• Difficulty breathing
• Severe chest pain
• Coughing up large amounts of blood
• Severe headache with neck stiffness
• High fever with confusion

## Special Considerations

### TB in Children:
• May have poor growth
• Prolonged fever
• Persistent cough
• Difficulty feeding (in infants)
• Irritability

### TB in People with HIV:
• Symptoms may be atypical
• May progress more rapidly
• Higher risk of extrapulmonary TB
• May have fewer respiratory symptoms

### TB in Elderly:
• Symptoms may be subtle
• May present as general weakness
• Less likely to have fever
• Higher risk of complications
