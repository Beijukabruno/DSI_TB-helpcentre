## TB Risk Factors Overview

### Higher Risk for TB Exposure:

• **Group settings where TB can spread:** Jails, prisons, hospices, skilled nursing facilities, shelters, and other healthcare facilities
• **Occupational exposure:** Working in mycobacteriology laboratories
• **Geographic risk:** Having lived in regions where TB is common (Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia)
• **Contact exposure:** Being in contact with someone known or suspected to have TB disease

### Higher Risk for Developing Active TB Disease:

• **Diabetes** (high blood sugar)
• **Weakened immune system** (HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive medications)
• **Malnutrition**
• **Tobacco use**
• **Harmful use of alcohol**
• **Intravenous drug use**
• **Immature or impaired immune system** (babies, children, elderly)
• **Chronic illnesses** (kidney disease, other long-term conditions)
• **Organ transplant recipients**
• **Cancer patients on chemotherapy**

## TB-HIV Co-infection

### Key Statistics:
- TB is a leading killer of people with HIV
- In 2023, there were an estimated **167,000 TB deaths among HIV-positive people**
- People with HIV are **18-20 times more likely** to develop active TB disease

### Why HIV Increases TB Risk:
- **Weakened immune system** cannot fight TB bacteria effectively
- **Higher risk of reactivation** of latent TB infection
- **More severe TB disease** progression
- **Increased mortality** if untreated

### HIV Testing for TB Patients:

All TB patients should be tested for HIV because:
- Early HIV detection improves treatment outcomes
- Coordinated treatment reduces mortality
- Prevents further HIV transmission

## Uganda Prison TB Crisis (2025)

Recent research highlights the extreme vulnerability of incarcerated populations:

• **Prison TB prevalence:** 1,900 per 100,000 (8x higher than general population)
• **Latent TB:** Nearly half of Uganda's prison population affected
• **HIV co-infection:** 11% prevalence among prisoners (2x general population)
• **Female prisoners:** Highest HIV rates at 21%
• **Prison overcrowding:** 340% capacity with 56,400 prisoners in facilities built for 16,612

*This study was conducted by Makerere University School of Public Health, Uganda Prisons Services, and Ministry of Health, with PEPFAR funding and CDC technical support.*

## Risk Reduction Strategies

### For High-Risk Individuals:
- Regular TB screening
- HIV testing and treatment if positive
- Latent TB infection testing and treatment
- Infection control measures in high-risk settings
- Nutritional support
- Smoking cessation programs

### For Healthcare Workers:
- Use of personal protective equipment
- Proper ventilation in healthcare facilities
- Regular health screenings
- TB infection control training
