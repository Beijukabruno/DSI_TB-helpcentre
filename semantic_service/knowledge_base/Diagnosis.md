# TB Diagnosis Methods and Procedures

*Sources: [WHO TB Fact Sheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis), [CDC TB Diagnosis Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/diagnosis/)*

## Overview

WHO recommends the use of **rapid molecular diagnostic tests** as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing transmission.

## Types of TB Testing

### 1. Tests for Active TB Disease

#### Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Tests (Recommended First-Line):
• **Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra**
  - High diagnostic accuracy
  - Detects TB bacteria and rifampicin resistance
  - Results available within 2 hours
  - Can be used on sputum, other body fluids

• **Truenat Assays**
  - Portable, battery-operated system
  - Detects TB bacteria and drug resistance
  - Suitable for remote areas
  - Results in 1-2 hours

#### Traditional Laboratory Tests:
• **Sputum Smear Microscopy**
  - Examines sputum under microscope
  - Looks for acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
  - Less sensitive than molecular tests
  - Results available same day

• **Sputum Culture**
  - Gold standard for TB diagnosis
  - Takes 2-8 weeks for results
  - Can determine drug susceptibility
  - Most sensitive test available

#### Imaging Tests:
• **Chest X-ray**
  - First imaging test for pulmonary TB
  - Shows lung abnormalities
  - Cannot confirm TB diagnosis alone
  - Useful for monitoring treatment

• **CT Scan**
  - More detailed than X-ray
  - Helps detect extrapulmonary TB
  - Used when X-ray is unclear
  - Can show early disease changes

### 2. Tests for TB Infection (Latent TB)

#### Tuberculin Skin Test (TST):
• **How it works**: Injection of tuberculin under skin
• **Reading**: Measured after 48-72 hours
• **Limitations**: Can give false positives in BCG-vaccinated individuals
• **Interpretation**: Depends on risk factors and immune status

#### Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):
• **QuantiFERON-Gold Plus**: Blood test measuring immune response
• **T-SPOT.TB**: Another type of IGRA
• **Advantages**: Not affected by BCG vaccination
• **Results**: Available within 24-48 hours

#### Antigen-Based Skin Tests (TBST):
• **Newer technology**: More specific than TST
• **Single visit**: Results read at same appointment
• **Less cross-reactivity**: Reduced false positives from BCG

## Diagnostic Challenges

### TB in Children:
• **Difficult to diagnose**: Children often cannot produce sputum
• **Special techniques**: Gastric aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirates
• **Clinical diagnosis**: Often based on symptoms and exposure history
• **Contact tracing**: Essential for identifying infected children

### TB in People with HIV:
• **Atypical presentation**: May not show typical symptoms
• **Extrapulmonary TB**: More common in HIV-positive patients
• **Lower sensitivity**: Some tests less reliable
• **Screening recommendations**: More frequent testing needed

### Drug-Resistant TB:
• **Complex testing**: Requires specialized laboratories
• **Drug susceptibility testing**: Essential for appropriate treatment
• **Rapid tests**: Xpert MTB/RIF can detect rifampicin resistance
• **Line probe assays**: Detect resistance to multiple drugs

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Clinical Assessment
• **Symptom evaluation**: Cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats
• **Risk factor assessment**: HIV status, contact history, travel
• **Physical examination**: Lymph nodes, chest examination

### Step 2: Initial Testing
• **Chest X-ray**: For all suspected pulmonary TB cases
• **Sputum collection**: 2-3 samples on different days
• **Rapid molecular test**: Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra preferred

### Step 3: Additional Testing (if needed)
• **Culture and drug susceptibility**: For all positive cases
• **Extrapulmonary samples**: If extrapulmonary TB suspected
• **HIV testing**: For all TB patients

### Step 4: Contact Investigation
• **Household contacts**: Test all close contacts
• **High-risk contacts**: Children under 5, immunocompromised
• **Workplace contacts**: If occupational exposure

## Sample Collection Guidelines

### Sputum Samples:
• **Early morning**: Best quality samples
• **Multiple samples**: At least 2-3 specimens
• **Proper technique**: Deep cough, not saliva
• **Storage**: Refrigerate if testing delayed

### Other Samples:
• **Pleural fluid**: For pleural TB
• **Urine**: For genitourinary TB
• **CSF**: For TB meningitis
• **Tissue biopsy**: For lymph node or other organ TB

## Interpretation of Results

### Positive Results:
• **Active TB confirmed**: Start treatment immediately
• **Drug resistance detected**: Modify treatment regimen
• **Contact tracing**: Investigate close contacts

### Negative Results:
• **Clinical TB possible**: Consider empirical treatment
• **Repeat testing**: If high clinical suspicion
• **Alternative diagnosis**: Consider other conditions

## Quality Assurance

### Laboratory Standards:
• **Certified laboratories**: Use accredited facilities
• **Quality control**: Regular proficiency testing
• **Biosafety measures**: Proper containment procedures
• **Staff training**: Qualified personnel only

## Cost and Accessibility

### In Uganda:
• **Free testing**: Available at public health facilities
• **Rapid tests**: Increasingly available at lower levels
• **Private sector**: May charge fees for services
• **Insurance coverage**: Some private insurance covers TB testing
