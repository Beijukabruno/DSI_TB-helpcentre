# Comprehensive Guidelines for the Treatment of Tuberculosis  
*Based on WHO Treatment of Tuberculosis: Guidelines (4th Edition, 2010) and Uganda NTLP Manual (3rd Edition, 2017)*

---

## 1. Introduction and Rationale

### 1.1 Purpose of the Guidelines
- To help National Tuberculosis Programmes (NTPs) set evidence-based treatment policies that **optimize cure**, **prevent death**, **reduce relapse**, and **halt transmission**.
- To guide clinicians in public and private sectors on standardized, effective TB care.
- To align with the **WHO End TB Strategy** and **Stop TB Strategy**, emphasizing **universal access**, **TB/HIV integration**, and **programmatic management of drug-resistant TB**.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- NTP managers and staff
- District and facility-level health workers
- Private practitioners and community health providers
- Laboratory and pharmacy personnel
- Policy makers and technical partners

### 1.3 Scope
- Covers **treatment of active TB in adults and children**.
- Includes **drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB**, **TB/HIV co-infection**, **extrapulmonary TB**, and **special populations**.
- **Excludes**: diagnosis algorithms (covered in NTLP manual), drug procurement logistics, infection control details (covered separately), and IPT (covered in dedicated sections).

---

## 2. Case Definitions

### 2.1 Standard TB Case Definitions
- **Presumptive TB patient**: Any person with symptoms or signs suggestive of TB (e.g., cough ≥2 weeks, fever, weight loss, night sweats).
- **Bacteriologically confirmed TB patient**: A patient with a biological specimen positive by:
  - Smear microscopy
  - Culture
  - Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) such as Xpert MTB/RIF
  - Other WHO-endorsed diagnostics
- **Clinically diagnosed TB patient**: A patient not bacteriologically confirmed but diagnosed by a clinician based on:
  - Chest X-ray abnormalities
  - Histological findings
  - Clinical judgment
  - Started on a full course of TB treatment

> **Note**: If a clinically diagnosed patient is later found to be bacteriologically positive, they must be **reclassified as confirmed**.

### 2.2 Classification of TB Patients

#### A. By Anatomical Site
- **Pulmonary TB (PTB)**: Involves lung parenchyma or tracheobronchial tree.
  - Includes miliary TB.
  - Endobronchial TB is highly infectious (presents with barking cough, wheezing).
- **Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB)**: Involves organs other than lungs:
  - Pleura, lymph nodes, abdomen, genitourinary tract, bones/joints, meninges, skin
- **Rule**: A patient with both PTB and EPTB is classified as **PTB** for public health and reporting purposes.

#### B. By History of Previous Treatment
- **New patient**: Never treated or treated for **<1 month**.
- **Previously treated patient**:
  - **Relapse**: Previously cured or completed treatment, now has recurrent TB.
  - **Treatment after failure**: Most recent treatment ended in failure.
  - **Treatment after loss to follow-up**: Interrupted treatment for **≥2 consecutive months**.
  - **Other previously treated**: Outcome of prior treatment is unknown or undocumented.
- **Transfer-in**: Patient moved from another treatment register.

#### C. By HIV Status
- **HIV-positive TB patient**: Confirmed HIV+ at TB diagnosis or documented in HIV care registers.
- **HIV-negative TB patient**: Confirmed HIV– at diagnosis.
- **HIV status unknown**: No test result available.
> **Reclassification required** if HIV status is later determined.

#### D. By Drug Resistance Pattern
- **Mono-resistance**: Resistance to **one** first-line drug only.
- **Poly-resistance**: Resistance to **more than one** first-line drug, **excluding both isoniazid and rifampicin**.
- **Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)**: Resistance to **at least isoniazid and rifampicin**.
- **Pre-XDR-TB**: MDR-TB plus resistance to **either** a fluoroquinolone **or** a second-line injectable (not both).
- **Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)**: MDR-TB plus resistance to **any fluoroquinolone AND at least one** of: amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin.
- **Rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB)**: Resistance to rifampicin (by Xpert or DST), **with or without** resistance to other drugs. **Includes all MDR/XDR cases**.

## 3. Standard Treatment Regimens

### 3.1 Aims of TB Treatment
- Cure the patient and restore quality of life
- Prevent death and complications
- Prevent relapse
- Reduce transmission
- Prevent development and spread of drug resistance

### 3.2 First-Line Anti-TB Drugs and Adult Dosing

#### Daily Dosing (mg/kg)
- **Isoniazid (H)**: 5 mg/kg (max 300 mg)
- **Rifampicin (R)**: 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg)
- **Pyrazinamide (Z)**: 25 mg/kg
- **Ethambutol (E)**: 15 mg/kg

#### Three-Times-Weekly Dosing (mg/kg)
- **Isoniazid**: 10 mg/kg (max 900 mg)
- **Rifampicin**: 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg)
- **Pyrazinamide**: 35 mg/kg
- **Ethambutol**: 30 mg/kg

> **Note**: Streptomycin is **not recommended** in Uganda’s standard regimens due to toxicity and programmatic complexity.

### 3.3 Fixed-Dose Combinations (FDCs)
- **Advantages**:
  - Fewer tablets → better adherence
  - Reduced prescription errors
  - Prevents selective drug intake (monotherapy)
  - Easier dose adjustment by weight band
- **Common FDCs in Uganda**:
  - RH (Rifampicin + Isoniazid)
  - RHZ (Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide)
  - RHZE (Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide + Ethambutol)

### 3.4 Recommended Regimens by Patient Category

#### A. New Patients (Drug-Susceptible TB)
- **Standard regimen**: **2HRZE / 4HR**
  - **Intensive phase (2 months)**: Daily RHZE
  - **Continuation phase (4 months)**: Daily HR
- **Dosing by weight (adults ≥15 years)**:
  - **33–39 kg**: 2 tablets of RHZE (150/75/400/275 mg) and RH (150/75 mg)
  - **40–54 kg**: 3 tablets
  - **55–70 kg**: 4 tablets
  - **>70 kg**: 5 tablets

#### B. Previously Treated Patients (Without Confirmed DR-TB)
- **If RR excluded by Xpert**: Treat as **new patient** with **2HRZE / 4HR**
- **Historical "Category II" (8-month) regimen is phased out** unless:
  - Rapid DST unavailable
  - Country-specific data show **low/medium MDR** in relapse/default patients
  - Then: **2HRZES / 1HRZE / 5HRE**

#### C. Drug-Resistant TB
- **RR/MDR-TB**:
  - **Shorter regimen (9–12 months)**: For new MDR patients **without** resistance to fluoroquinolones or injectables
  - **Standard regimen (18–24 months)**: For complex cases, treatment failures, or XDR-TB

#### D. Special Forms of TB
- **TB meningitis, bone/joint TB**: **2HRZE / 10HR** (total 12 months)
  - Add **steroids** (prednisolone or dexamethasone) for meningitis
- **Endobronchial TB**: Same as PTB; highly infectious

## 4. Treatment Monitoring and Outcomes

### 4.1 Monitoring Methods

#### A. Laboratory Monitoring (Pulmonary TB)
- **New patients**:
  - Sputum smear at **end of intensive phase (month 2)**
    - If **positive**: Repeat smear at **month 3**
      - If **still positive**: Perform **culture and DST**
  - Sputum smear at **month 5 and 6**
    - If **positive at month 5 or 6**: Diagnose **treatment failure**
- **Previously treated patients**:
  - Sputum smear at **month 3, 5, and 8**
    - If **positive at month 3**: Perform **culture and DST**

#### B. Clinical Monitoring
- Essential for **children**, **EPTB**, and **HIV+ patients**
- Assess:
  - Weight gain
  - Symptom resolution (cough, fever, appetite)
  - Adverse drug reactions

#### C. Radiological Monitoring
- **Not used alone** for monitoring
- CXR may be repeated if:
  - Clinical deterioration
  - Suspected complications (e.g., aspergilloma)
  - Pre-surgical evaluation

### 4.2 Standard Treatment Outcomes (Drug-Susceptible TB)
- **Cured**: Smear/culture-negative at end of treatment **and** on at least one prior occasion
- **Treatment completed**: Completed treatment without evidence of failure, **but no bacteriological confirmation**
- **Treatment failed**: Smear/culture-positive at **month 5 or later**, **or** positive at month 2 after starting negative
- **Died**: Death at any time during treatment (any cause)
- **Lost to follow-up**: Treatment interrupted for **≥2 consecutive months**
- **Not evaluated**: Transferred out or outcome unknown
- **Treatment success**: **Cured + Treatment completed**

## 5. Management of Adverse Drug Reactions

### 5.1 Common Side Effects and Management

#### Major Reactions (Stop drug and refer)
- **Skin rash**: Stop all drugs; reintroduce one at a time after resolution
- **Deafness or vertigo**: Stop streptomycin (use ethambutol instead)
- **Jaundice**: Stop all hepatotoxic drugs (H, R, Z); restart cautiously after resolution
- **Visual impairment**: Stop ethambutol immediately; refer for ophthalmology
- **Shock, purpura, renal failure**: Stop rifampicin

#### Minor Reactions (Continue treatment with symptomatic care)
- **Nausea/abdominal pain**: Give drugs with food or at bedtime
- **Joint pains**: Use paracetamol or ibuprofen
- **Burning feet**: Give pyridoxine 25–100 mg daily
- **Orange/red urine**: Reassure (harmless effect of rifampicin)
- **Flu-like syndrome**: Switch from intermittent to daily rifampicin

### 5.2 Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
- **Suspect if**: Jaundice, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine
- **If ALT/AST >3x upper limit**: Stop all anti-TB drugs
- **After normalization**:
  - Restart with **rifampicin first** (least hepatotoxic)
  - Add **isoniazid after 3–7 days**
  - **Avoid pyrazinamide** if jaundice occurred
- **Alternative regimens for severe liver disease**:
  - **2HES / 10HE** (if rifampicin contraindicated)
  - **18–24 months**: Streptomycin + ethambutol + fluoroquinolone
