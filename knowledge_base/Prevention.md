## Overview

Prevention is the most effective way to control tuberculosis. TB prevention strategies focus on both preventing infection and preventing progression from infection to active disease.

## Primary Prevention Strategies

### 1. Early Detection and Treatment
• **Seek medical attention immediately** if you have symptoms like:
  - Prolonged cough (3+ weeks)
  - Fever
  - Unexplained weight loss
  - Night sweats
• **Early treatment** helps stop the spread of disease and improves recovery chances

### 2. TB Screening and Testing
• **Get tested for TB** if you are at increased risk:
  - Have HIV or other immune system conditions
  - In contact with people who have TB in household or workplace
  - Live in high-risk settings (prisons, shelters, healthcare facilities)
  - Have traveled to or lived in high TB prevalence areas

### 3. TB Preventive Treatment (TPT)
• **TPT prevents infection from becoming disease**
• **Complete the full course** if prescribed TPT
• Usually involves taking medication for 3-9 months
• Highly effective in preventing active TB disease

## Infection Control Measures

### Personal Hygiene Practices:
• **Cover mouth and nose** when coughing or sneezing
• **Wear a mask** if you have TB symptoms
• **Dispose of sputum and tissues properly**
• **Avoid close contact** with others if you have active TB
• **Ensure good ventilation** in living spaces

### For Healthcare Settings:
• **Use respirators and masks** (N95 or higher)
• **Proper ventilation systems** in healthcare facilities
• **Isolation procedures** for TB patients
• **Regular health screenings** for healthcare workers
• **TB infection control training** for staff

## BCG Vaccination

• **Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine** is given to babies or small children in certain countries
• **Prevents deaths from TB** and protects children from serious forms of TB
• **Most effective in children** - prevents severe forms like TB meningitis
• **Limited effectiveness in adults** in preventing pulmonary TB

## High-Risk Population Prevention

### For People with HIV:
• **Regular TB screening** every healthcare visit
• **TB preventive treatment** if latent TB detected
• **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** to strengthen immune system
• **Improved nutrition** and general health care

### For Healthcare Workers:
• **Annual TB screening**
• **Proper use of personal protective equipment**
• **Training on TB infection control**
• **Baseline and follow-up TB testing**

### For Prisoners and Institutional Settings:
• **Entry screening** for all new inmates/residents
• **Regular health monitoring**
• **Improved ventilation** in facilities
• **Contact tracing** when cases are identified
• **Reduced overcrowding** where possible

## Household and Contact Prevention

### If Someone in Your Household Has TB:
• **All household members should be tested**
• **Children under 5** especially need immediate evaluation
• **Follow medical advice** about preventive treatment
• **Maintain good ventilation** in shared spaces
• **Patient should wear mask** until no longer infectious

### Contact Investigation:
• **Identify close contacts** of TB patients
• **Test all contacts** for TB infection and disease
• **Provide preventive treatment** to those with latent TB
• **Monitor contacts** for development of symptoms

## Lifestyle and General Health Measures

### Strengthen Immune System:
• **Maintain good nutrition**
• **Avoid tobacco use** (increases TB risk by 2-3 times)
• **Limit alcohol consumption**
• **Manage chronic conditions** like diabetes
• **Get adequate sleep and exercise**

### Environmental Measures:
• **Ensure good air circulation** in homes and workplaces
• **Avoid crowded, poorly ventilated spaces**
• **Maintain clean living conditions**

## Prevention for Travelers

### Before Traveling to High TB Areas:
• **Consult healthcare provider** about TB risk
• **Consider baseline TB testing**
• **Learn about TB symptoms**
• **Know how to access healthcare** in destination country

### During Travel:
• **Avoid crowded, poorly ventilated spaces**
• **Seek medical care** if symptoms develop
• **Practice good respiratory hygiene**

### After Return:
• **Get TB screening** if at high risk or symptomatic
• **Monitor for symptoms** for several months
• **Inform healthcare providers** about travel history
