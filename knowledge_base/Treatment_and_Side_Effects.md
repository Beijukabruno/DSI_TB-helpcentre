## Overview

Tuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and active TB disease. Free TB treatment is available at all public health facilities.

## Standard TB Treatment (Active Disease)

### Most Common Antibiotics Used:
• **Isoniazid (INH)**
• **Rifampicin (RIF)**
• **Pyrazinamide (PZA)**
• **Ethambutol (EMB)**

### Treatment Duration:
• **4-6 months** for most cases
• **Daily medication** is essential
• **Never stop early** - dangerous and can cause drug resistance

### Treatment Phases:

#### Intensive Phase (First 2 months):
• All 4 medicines taken daily
• Most TB bacteria killed during this phase
• Patient usually becomes non-infectious after 2-3 weeks

#### Continuation Phase (4-6 months):
• Usually 2 medicines (INH and RIF)
• Eliminates remaining bacteria
• Prevents relapse

## Treatment for Latent TB (Inactive TB)

### Duration Options:
• **3 months:** INH + Rifapentine (weekly doses)
• **4 months:** Rifampin daily
• **6 months:** INH daily
• **9 months:** INH daily

### Benefits:
• Prevents progression to active TB
• 90% effective when completed
• Reduces transmission risk

## Drug-Resistant TB Treatment

### Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB):
• **Resistant to:** Isoniazid and Rifampicin
• **Treatment duration:** 18-24 months
• **Medications:** Second-line drugs (more toxic and expensive)
• **Success rate:** Lower than drug-sensitive TB

### Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB):
• **Resistant to:** Many first-line and second-line drugs
• **Treatment:** Very complex, limited options
• **Duration:** 24 months or longer
• **Specialist care:** Requires TB expert management

### New Treatment Options (2022):
• **BPaLM/BPaL regimen:** 6-month all-oral treatment
• **Bedaquiline, Pretomanid, Linezolid, Moxifloxacin**
• Significant improvement over traditional MDR-TB treatment

## Treatment Monitoring

### Regular Medical Visits:
• **Monthly appointments** during treatment
• **Medication adherence** assessment
• **Side effect monitoring**
• **Treatment response** evaluation

### Laboratory Tests:
• **Baseline tests:** Before starting treatment
• **Monthly monitoring:** Liver function, kidney function
• **Sputum tests:** To monitor treatment response
• **HIV testing:** For all TB patients

### Directly Observed Therapy (DOT):
• **Healthcare worker supervision** of medication taking
• **Ensures adherence** to treatment regimen
• **Improves outcomes** and reduces resistance
• **May be required** for some patients

## Side Effects

### Minor Side Effects:
• **Skin rash** - Any TB medicine can cause this
• **Upset stomach or nausea** - Taking with food helps
• **Orange-colored body fluids** - Normal with rifampin (urine, tears, saliva, sweat)
• **Joint aches**
• **Headache**

### Serious Side Effects (Seek immediate medical attention):

#### Liver Injury:
• **Abdominal pain**
• **Nausea and vomiting**
• **Skin and eyes turning yellow (jaundice)**
• **Dark urine**
• **Light-colored stools**
• **Loss of appetite**

#### Other Serious Effects:
• **Severe dizziness or lightheadedness**
• **Persistent flu-like symptoms**
• **Tingling or numbness in hands or feet**
• **Visual changes** (blurred vision, color blindness)
• **Hearing problems or ringing in ears**

### Specific Medication Side Effects:

#### Isoniazid (INH):
• **Liver toxicity** (most serious)
• **Peripheral neuropathy** (tingling/numbness)
• **Psychiatric effects** (rarely)
• **Prevention:** Vitamin B6 supplements often given

#### Rifampin (RIF):
• **Orange discoloration** of body fluids
• **Liver toxicity**
• **Drug interactions** (affects many medications)
• **Flu-like syndrome** (with intermittent dosing)

#### Pyrazinamide (PZA):
• **Liver toxicity**
• **Joint pain** (gout-like)
• **Skin rash**
• **Gastrointestinal upset**

#### Ethambutol (EMB):
• **Visual problems** (color blindness, blurred vision)
• **Skin rash**
• **Joint pain**
• **Gastrointestinal upset**

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:
• **Safe medications:** INH, RIF, EMB
• **Avoid:** Streptomycin (can harm fetus)
• **Breastfeeding:** Generally safe to continue treatment
• **Inform provider** if pregnant or planning pregnancy

### Drug Interactions:
• **Birth control pills:** May be less effective with rifampin
• **HIV medications:** May require dosage adjustments
• **Warfarin:** Blood thinner effects may change
• **Diabetes medications:** May need monitoring

### Alcohol and TB Treatment:
• **Avoid alcohol** - increases liver toxicity risk
• **Especially dangerous** with INH and RIF
• **Can worsen side effects**
• **May reduce treatment effectiveness**

### Children:
• **Same principles** as adult treatment
• **Weight-based dosing**
• **Special formulations** may be needed
• **Close monitoring** required

### HIV Co-infection:
• **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** usually continued
• **Drug interactions** require careful management
• **Immune reconstitution** syndrome possible
• **Specialist care** recommended

## Treatment Success Factors

### Patient Factors:
• **Take medications exactly as prescribed**
• **Complete full course** even if feeling better
• **Keep all medical appointments**
• **Report side effects immediately**
• **Maintain good nutrition**
• **Avoid alcohol and smoking**

### Healthcare System Factors:
• **Free treatment** availability
• **Regular drug supply**
• **Trained healthcare workers**
• **Laboratory monitoring** capacity
• **Contact tracing** services

## What to Expect During Treatment

### First 2-4 weeks:
• **Symptoms begin improving**
• **Become non-infectious** (if pulmonary TB)
• **May experience minor side effects**
• **Energy levels start returning**

### After 2 months:
• **Significant improvement** in symptoms
• **Sputum becomes negative** (most patients)
• **Chest X-ray shows improvement**
• **Can return to normal activities**

### Treatment completion:
• **Full recovery** expected
• **Very low relapse risk** if treatment completed
• **Return to normal life**
• **Follow-up as recommended**

• Yellowing of skin or eyes
• Severe abdominal pain
• Persistent vomiting
• Dark urine or light stools
• Severe fatigue or weakness
