*Sources: [WHO TB Fact Sheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis), [WHO Global TB Report 2024](https://www.who.int/publications/digital/global-tuberculosis-report-2024)*

## Global TB Burden (2023)

### Key Statistics:
• **10.8 million people** fell ill with TB worldwide
• **1.25 million people died** from TB (including 161,000 people with HIV)
• **TB has returned** to being the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent
• **79 million lives saved** since 2000 through global TB efforts

### Demographic Breakdown:
• **6.0 million men** (56% of cases)
• **3.6 million women** (33% of cases) 
• **1.3 million children** (12% of cases)
• **TB affects all countries and age groups**

### Age Groups at Risk:
• **Adults in productive years** most affected
• **Over 80% of cases and deaths** in low- and middle-income countries
• **Children and elderly** at higher risk for severe disease

## Geographic Distribution (2023)

### Regional Breakdown:
• **WHO South-East Asia Region:** 45% of new cases
• **African Region:** 24% of new cases
• **Western Pacific Region:** 17% of new cases
• **Eastern Mediterranean Region:** 8% of new cases
• **Region of the Americas:** 4% of new cases
• **European Region:** 2% of new cases

### High-Burden Countries:
• **87% of new TB cases** occurred in 30 high TB burden countries
• **Two-thirds of global total** in 8 countries:
  - India
  - Indonesia
  - China
  - Philippines
  - Pakistan
  - Nigeria
  - Bangladesh
  - Democratic Republic of the Congo

### African Context:
• **Highest TB burden region** per capita
• **High HIV-TB co-infection rates**
• **Limited healthcare infrastructure** in many areas
• **Resource constraints** affecting TB control

## Economic Impact

### Healthcare Costs:
• **50% of people treated for TB** face catastrophic costs (>20% of household income)
• **Far from WHO End TB Strategy target** of zero catastrophic costs
• **Lost productivity** due to illness and death
• **Household financial burden** particularly severe in low-income countries

### Global Funding Gap:
• **US$ 22 billion needed annually** for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care
• **Current funding insufficient** to meet 2027 global targets
• **Research funding gap:** Only US$ 1.0 billion vs. US$ 5 billion needed annually

### Funding Sources (2023):
• **80% of TB service spending** from domestic sources
• **International donor funding** crucial for low- and middle-income countries
• **Decline of US$ 1.2 billion** in domestic funding (2019-2023)
• **Slight increase of US$ 0.1 billion** in international donor funding

## TB-Related Deaths

### Mortality Statistics (2023):
• **1.25 million total deaths** from TB
• **161,000 deaths** among HIV-positive people
• **TB-HIV co-infection:** Leading cause of death among people with HIV
• **Case fatality rate:** Varies by region and HIV status

### Preventable Deaths:
• **Most TB deaths are preventable** with early diagnosis and treatment
• **Delays in diagnosis** contribute to higher mortality
• **Drug-resistant TB** has higher mortality rates
• **Malnutrition and HIV** increase death risk

## Risk Factor Attribution (2023)

### New TB Cases Attributable to:
• **Undernutrition:** 0.96 million cases
• **Alcohol use disorders:** 0.75 million cases
• **Smoking:** 0.70 million cases
• **HIV infection:** 0.61 million cases
• **Diabetes:** 0.38 million cases

### Modifiable Risk Factors:
• **Poverty and malnutrition** major drivers
• **Tobacco use** significantly increases risk
• **Alcohol abuse** weakens immune system
• **Diabetes** doubles TB risk
• **Air pollution** emerging risk factor

## Drug Resistance Global Picture

### 2023 Drug Resistance Data:
• **410,000 people** developed rifampicin-resistant TB
• **66% treatment success rate** for MDR/RR-TB (vs. 86% for drug-sensitive TB)
• **5,646 people** started on new BPaLM/BPaL regimen
• **Highest MDR-TB rates** in Eastern Europe and Central Asia

### Challenges:
• **Limited access** to drug susceptibility testing
• **High treatment costs** for drug-resistant TB
• **Longer treatment duration** reduces adherence
• **More severe side effects** than drug-sensitive TB

## Progress and Challenges

### Achievements Since 2000:
• **79 million lives saved** through global efforts
• **TB mortality rate** declined significantly
• **Treatment success rates** improved
• **New diagnostic tools** developed and deployed
• **Shorter treatment regimens** for drug-resistant TB

### Remaining Challenges:
• **TB incidence** declining too slowly to meet targets
• **COVID-19 pandemic** disrupted TB services
• **Funding gaps** limit program expansion
• **Health system weaknesses** in high-burden countries
• **Social determinants** not adequately addressed

## WHO End TB Strategy Targets

### 2030 Targets:
• **90% reduction** in TB incidence (compared to 2015)
• **95% reduction** in TB deaths (compared to 2015)
• **Zero catastrophic costs** for TB patients and families

### 2027 Interim Targets:
• **75% reduction** in TB incidence
• **85% reduction** in TB deaths
• **Significant progress** toward zero catastrophic costs

### Current Progress:
• **Off track** to meet 2030 targets at current pace
• **Accelerated efforts** needed in all areas
• **Political commitment** essential for success

## Innovation and Research Needs

### Priority Areas:
• **New diagnostic tools** for rapid, point-of-care testing
• **Shorter treatment regimens** for all forms of TB
• **Better preventive treatments**
• **Improved vaccines** for children and adults
• **Host-directed therapies**

### Research Funding:
• **Current investment:** US$ 1.0 billion annually
• **Target investment:** US$ 5 billion annually
• **Gap:** US$ 4 billion annually
• **Innovation pipeline** insufficient for needs

## Special Populations

### Children:
• **1.3 million children** affected globally
• **Under-diagnosis** common in children
• **Limited child-friendly formulations**
• **Contact tracing** essential for prevention

### Women:
• **3.6 million women** affected globally
• **Gender-specific barriers** to healthcare access
• **Pregnancy considerations** for treatment
• **Social and economic vulnerabilities**

### Elderly:
• **Increasing burden** in aging populations
• **Comorbidities** complicate treatment
• **Higher mortality rates**
• **Reactivation** of latent infection common

## Future Outlook

### Projections:
• **Without accelerated action:** Targets will not be met
• **COVID-19 impact:** May reverse recent progress
• **Population growth:** Will increase absolute case numbers
• **Climate change:** May affect TB transmission patterns

### Opportunities:
• **New tools and treatments** becoming available
• **Political momentum** from 2023 UN High-Level Meeting
• **Improved financing mechanisms**
• **Multi-sectoral approaches** gaining traction
