## 2.1 Tuberculosis Disease

### 2.1.1 Causative Organism
- Caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex, including:
  - *M. tuberculosis* (most common)
  - *M. bovis*
  - *M. africanum*
  - *M. microti*
- Referred to as tubercle bacilli or acid-fast bacilli (AFB).

### 2.1.2 Transmission
- Occurs when a person with infectious pulmonary TB expels droplet nuclei by coughing, sneezing, or singing.
- Droplet nuclei (<5 µm) remain airborne and can be inhaled into alveoli.
- Transmission is more likely in:
  - Poorly ventilated, closed environments.
  - Prolonged close contact with a sputum smear-positive TB patient.
  - High bacillary load in the source patient.
  - High community TB prevalence.
- Risk is low with occasional contact or extra-pulmonary TB.

### 2.1.3 Infection and Development of TB Disease
- Primary infection occurs on first exposure; bacilli multiply in lungs and lymph nodes.
- Immunity develops in ~90% of infected persons within 6–8 weeks, controlling bacillary growth.
- Infected persons may have latent TB infection (LTBI), detectable by tuberculin skin test (TST) or IGRA.
- ~10% develop active TB soon after infection (primary disease), especially if immunocompromised (e.g., HIV, diabetes, malnutrition).
- Reactivation (post-primary disease) can occur later if immunity wanes.
- ~90% of active TB cases result from reactivation.

## 2.2 Diagnosis of Tuberculosis

### 2.2.1 Approach to Diagnosis
- Based on compatible history (including TB contact), symptoms, and positive tests.
- All presumptive TB patients should be tested for HIV.
- Patients at risk of drug resistance must be screened for resistance.
- Diagnosis must be recorded and notified regardless of treatment start.
- Use the **Intensified TB Case Finding (ICF) guide** to screen all patients at care entry points.
- Presumptive TB patients are those with symptoms suggestive of TB.

#### Symptoms Suggestive of TB
- Constitutional: fever (especially evening), weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite.
- Pulmonary TB (PTB): cough >2 weeks, chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea.
- In HIV-positive or immunosuppressed patients: any duration of respiratory symptoms may suggest TB.

### 2.2.2 Laboratory Diagnosis

#### Microscopy
- Most widely available test; uses Ziehl-Neelsen or fluorescence microscopy.
- Examines sputum, gastric aspirate, or other specimens for AFB.
- Requires two specimens: 1 spot and 1 early morning.

#### Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)
- **Xpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert)**:
  - Automated DNA test detecting *M. tuberculosis* and rifampicin resistance (rpoB mutation).
  - Can test sputum, lymph node tissue, pleural fluid, CSF, gastric aspirates.
  - Recommended as the initial diagnostic test for all presumptive TB patients.

##### Xpert MTB/RIF Results and Interpretation
- **MTB detected**:
  - Patient has bacteriologically confirmed TB.
  - Start TB treatment.
- **MTB not detected**:
  - Does not exclude TB, especially in children, HIV-positive, or extra-pulmonary TB.
  - Further investigation required (e.g., CXR, clinical assessment).
  - In HIV-positive adults with CD4 ≤100 or seriously ill, consider urine LAM test.
- **Rifampicin resistance detected**:
  - Patient has rifampicin-resistant TB.
  - Requires full first- and second-line DST to confirm MDR/XDR-TB.
- **Rifampicin susceptible**:
  - Patient has rifampicin-susceptible TB.
  - Does not exclude resistance to other first-line drugs (H, Z, E).

- **Line Probe Assay (LPA)**:
  - Detects mutations for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance.
  - Used when rapid MDR confirmation is needed.

#### Culture
- More sensitive than smear or NAATs; can detect low bacillary loads.
- Identifies mycobacterial species and enables drug susceptibility testing (DST).
- Uses solid (LJ) or liquid (MGIT) media.
- Results take 6–8 weeks; DST takes longer.
- Recommended for:
  - Smear-negative HIV-positive suspects.
  - Patients with poor treatment response.
  - Previously treated TB patients.

#### Antigen Tests
- **TB LAM (Lipoarabinomannan) test**:
  - Detects LAM in urine.
  - Recommended for HIV-positive adults who are:
    - In-patients with signs/symptoms of TB and CD4 ≤100 cells/µL, OR
    - "Seriously ill" (defined as: respiratory rate >30/min, temperature >39°C, heart rate >120/min, or unable to walk unaided).

### 2.2.3 Radiology
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)** findings consistent with TB:
  - Cavitation
  - Miliary pattern
  - Pleural effusion
  - Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with lung infiltration
  - Heterogeneous opacities in upper lung zones
- All bacteriologically negative presumptive TB patients should have CXR.
- If CXR is suggestive of TB, start treatment.

### 2.2.4 Histology
- Used for extra-pulmonary TB (e.g., lymphadenitis).
- Characteristic granulomatous inflammation confirms diagnosis.
- Samples obtained via:
  - Fine needle aspiration (lymph nodes)
  - Tissue biopsy (pleura, pericardium, skin, liver, etc.)

### 2.2.5 Standard TB Case Definitions
- **Presumptive TB patient**: Any patient with symptoms/signs suggestive of TB.
- **Bacteriologically confirmed TB patient**: Biological specimen positive by smear, culture, NAAT (e.g., Xpert), or WHO-recommended diagnostics.
- **Clinically diagnosed TB patient**: Not bacteriologically confirmed but diagnosed by clinician based on CXR, histology, or clinical judgment and started on full TB treatment.
  - If later found bacteriologically positive, reclassify as confirmed.

### 2.2.6 Classification of TB Patients
Classification is based on four factors:

#### 1. Site of Disease
- **Pulmonary TB (PTB)**: Involves lung parenchyma or tracheobronchial tree.
  - Includes endobronchial TB (highly infectious; presents with barking cough, wheezing).
- **Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB)**: Involves organs other than lungs (e.g., pleura, lymph nodes, abdomen, meninges).
- **Note**: Patients with both PTB and EPTB are classified as PTB.

#### 2. History of Treatment
- **New patient**: Never treated or treated <1 month.
- **Previously treated patient**:
  - **Relapse**: Completed treatment, declared cured/completed, now recurrent TB.
  - **Treatment after failure**: Treatment failed in most recent course.
  - **Treatment after loss to follow-up**: Interrupted treatment for ≥2 months.
  - **Other previously treated**: Outcome unknown or undocumented.
- **Note**: New and relapse cases are incident TB cases.

#### 3. HIV Status
- **HIV-positive TB patient**: Positive HIV test at diagnosis or documented in HIV care registers.
- **HIV-negative TB patient**: Negative HIV test at diagnosis.
- **HIV status unknown**: No test result or documentation.
- Patients should be reclassified if HIV status is later determined.

#### 4. Drug Resistance
- **Mono-resistance**: Resistance to one first-line drug.
- **Poly-resistance**: Resistance to >1 first-line drug (not both H and R).
- **Multidrug resistance (MDR-TB)**: Resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.
- **Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)**: MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one second-line injectable (amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin).
- **Rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB)**: Resistance to rifampicin (by phenotypic or genotypic methods), with or without resistance to other drugs.
  - Includes mono-, poly-, MDR-, and XDR-TB with rifampicin resistance.

### 2.2.7 Post-TB Patients
- Patients successfully treated for TB who present later with respiratory symptoms (cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis).
- First step: Repeat standard TB evaluation (sputum, CXR).
  - If TB confirmed: treat as retreatment case.
  - If TB excluded: evaluate for post-TB lung disease (e.g., bronchiectasis, COPD, aspergillosis).
- Avoid repeated empirical TB treatment without confirmation.

## 2.3 Treatment of Tuberculosis

### 2.3.1 Anti-TB Medicines
- **First-line drugs** (for drug-susceptible TB):
  - Rifampicin (R)
  - Isoniazid (H)
  - Pyrazinamide (Z)
  - Ethambutol (E)
- **Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs)** are preferred:
  - Advantages: fewer tablets, reduced prescription errors, better adherence, prevents selective drug intake.
  - Examples: RH, RHZ, RHZE.

### 2.3.2 TB Treatment Regimens
- Regimens include initial (intensive) and continuation phases.
- Written as: [Initial phase]/[Continuation phase] (e.g., 2RHZE/4RH).
- Duration in months precedes drug abbreviations.

### 2.3.3 Recommended Treatment Regimen Based on Disease Classification
- **Drug-susceptible TB (new and previously treated)**:
  - Standard: **2RHZE/4RH**
  - For TB meningitis, bone/joint TB: **2RHZE/10RH** (steroids may be added for meningitis).
- **Rifampicin-resistant TB (RR/MDR-TB)**:
  - Short-course regimen: 9–11 months (for new MDR patients without FQ/injectable resistance).
  - Standard regimen: 20–24 months (for previously treated MDR patients).

### 2.3.4 Recommended Standard Regimens in Uganda

#### I. Drug-Susceptible TB
- **Initial phase (2 months)**: RHZE
  - Rapidly kills bacilli; renders patients non-infectious within ~2 weeks.
- **Continuation phase (4 months)**: RH
  - Eliminates residual bacilli and prevents relapse.

##### Adult Dosing (≥15 years, by weight)
- **33–39 kg**: 2 tablets of RHZE (150/75/400/275 mg) and RH (150/75 mg)
- **40–54 kg**: 3 tablets
- **55–70 kg**: 4 tablets
- **>70 kg**: 5 tablets

#### II. Rifampicin-Resistant TB
- Treated with second-line regimens per national RR/MDR-TB guidelines.

### 2.3.5 Adjunctive Therapy
- **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)**:
  - Given to all patients on isoniazid (25 mg daily).
  - Prevents peripheral neuropathy.
  - Higher dose (up to 200 mg) if neuropathy occurs.
- **Prednisolone**:
  - Used in TB meningitis or severe inflammatory complications.
  - Dose: 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) for 4 weeks, then taper over 2 weeks.

### 2.3.6 Managing Common Side Effects of Anti-TB Drugs
- **Nausea, abdominal pain (Z, R)**: Give with small meal or at bedtime.
- **Joint pains (Z)**: Use analgesics (ibuprofen, paracetamol).
- **Burning feet (H)**: Pyridoxine 25–100 mg daily.
- **Orange/red urine (R)**: Reassure patient; harmless.
- **Skin rash (any drug)**: Stop all drugs; reintroduce one at a time or refer.
- **Deafness, vertigo (S)**: Stop streptomycin; use ethambutol.
- **Jaundice (H, R, Z)**: Stop all drugs until resolved; restart cautiously.
- **Mental confusion (H, R, Z)**:
  - If jaundiced: treat as liver failure.
  - If not: increase pyridoxine.
- **Visual impairment (E)**: Stop ethambutol; refer.

### 2.3.7 Treatment Monitoring
- **Laboratory monitoring (pulmonary TB)**:
  - Sputum smear at end of initial phase (2 months), 5 months, and 6 months.
  - Positive smear at 2 months: do Xpert MTB/RIF.
    - If RR: refer for MDR treatment.
    - If RS: continue first-line; explore adherence; repeat smear at 3 months.
  - Positive smear at 5 or 6 months: diagnose treatment failure; do Xpert.
- **Clinical monitoring**:
  - Essential for children and EPTB.
  - Assess weight gain, symptom reduction.
- **Radiological monitoring**:
  - Not used alone; must accompany sputum/clinical monitoring.

### 2.3.8 Defining Treatment Outcomes (Drug-Susceptible TB)
- **Cured**: Smear/culture-negative at end of treatment and on at least one prior occasion.
- **Treatment completed**: Completed treatment without failure, but no bacteriological confirmation of cure.
- **Treatment failed**: Smear/culture-positive at month 5 or later, or smear-positive at 2 months after starting negative.
- **Died**: Death before or during treatment (any cause).
- **Lost to follow-up**: Treatment interrupted for ≥2 consecutive months.
- **Not evaluated**: Outcome unknown (e.g., transferred out).
- **Treatment success**: Cured + treatment completed.

### 2.3.9 Treatment Adherence
- **Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)** is key:
  - **Facility-based DOT**: Observed by health worker (for inpatients or those near facility).
  - **Community-based DOT (CB-DOT)**: Observed by trained community member (VHT, family, etc.).
- **Implementation in rural settings**:
  - Sub-county Health Worker (SCHW) coordinates.
  - VHT/LC1 identifies treatment supporter.
  - SCHW trains supporter, provides 2-week drug supply, and supervises.
- **Implementation in urban settings**:
  - Use Community Linkage Facilitators (CLFs).
  - Provide 2-week (intensive) or 4-week (continuation) drug supply.
  - Strengthen referral systems and integrate TB/HIV services.
- **Private providers**:
  - Train on TB diagnosis, recording, and reporting.
  - Provide free anti-TB drugs; monitor for adherence to NTLP guidelines.

## 2.4 Preventive Tuberculosis Therapy

### 2.4.1 Why TB Preventive Therapy
- Prevents progression from latent TB infection (LTBI) to active disease.
- Reduces TB risk by >60%; up to 83% with 12-month isoniazid.
- Recommended for high-risk groups.

### 2.4.2 Target Populations
- People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)
- Child contacts (<5 years) of infectious TB patients
- Persons with immunosuppression (e.g., diabetes)
- PLHIV in congregate settings (prisons, IDPs, health workers)

### 2.4.3 Principles of Initiation
1. Diagnose LTBI (e.g., TST ≥5 mm in HIV+ or ≥10 mm in HIV–).
2. Exclude active TB using symptom screening.
3. Use effective regimens (e.g., isoniazid monotherapy or with rifampicin).

### 2.4.4 Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT)
- **For PLHIV**:
  - Screen with 4-symptom tool (current cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats).
  - If no symptoms: offer 6 months IPT (10 mg/kg/day), regardless of CD4, ART status, or pregnancy.
  - TST not required but preferred if feasible.
- **For children**:
  - HIV+ children >12 months: 6 months IPT if no active TB.
  - HIV+ infants <12 months: IPT only if TB contact and no active TB.
  - All children <5 years with TB contact: 6 months IPT after excluding active TB.

### 2.4.5 IPT in Special Situations
- **Pregnancy**: Safe; do not exclude pregnant women from IPT.
- **MDR-TB contacts**: IPT not recommended; use clinical monitoring and infection control.
- **Injecting drug users**: Screen for TB, HIV, hepatitis; provide harm reduction.

### 2.4.6 Monitoring for Toxicity
- Watch for hepatotoxicity (anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine).
- Baseline and periodic LFTs recommended for:
  - History of liver disease
  - Alcohol use
  - HIV infection
  - Age >35 years
  - Pregnancy/postpartum

### 2.4.7 Facilitating Adherence
- Monthly follow-up; initial check at 2 weeks.
- Address side effects, provide education, reduce stigma.
- If active TB develops during IPT: stop IPT and start full TB treatment.

## 2.5 Treatment of Tuberculosis in Special Situations

### 2.5.1 Pregnancy
- Screen and test as in non-pregnant women; avoid CXR if possible.
- Standard regimen **2RHZE/4RH** is safe.
- Avoid aminoglycosides (ototoxic to fetus) and ethionamide (teratogenic) in DR-TB.
- Screen for HIV; manage per national guidelines.

### 2.5.2 Breastfeeding
- Treat with standard regimen.
- Anti-TB drugs in breast milk are insufficient for infant treatment/prophylaxis.
- Investigate infant for TB:
  - If TB disease: full treatment.
  - If no TB: 6 months IPT (10 mg/kg).
- Continue breastfeeding with infection control measures.
- Delay BCG vaccination until after IPT completion.

### 2.5.3 Liver Disease
- In severe liver disease: consider regimens without rifampicin (e.g., streptomycin + ethambutol).
- Refer to higher-level facility.

### 2.5.4 Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
- Suspect if jaundice ± abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
- If ALT/AST >3x upper limit: stop all drugs until normal.
- Reintroduce drugs cautiously, avoiding most hepatotoxic agents (Z, H) first.

### 2.5.5 Renal Failure
- Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide: normal doses (hepatic elimination).
- Give pyridoxine to prevent neuropathy.
- Refer to higher-level care.

### 2.5.6 Contraceptives
- Rifampicin reduces efficacy of estrogen-containing contraceptives.
- Use high-estrogen pills (e.g., NewFem, Ovral) or add barrier methods.

### 2.5.7 Bone, Joint, and Spinal TB
- Treat with **2RHZE/10RH** (9–12 months total).
- Surgery considered for:
  - Poor response to chemotherapy
  - Cord compression with neurological deficits
  - Spinal instability

### 2.5.8 TB Meningitis
- Treat with **2RHZE/10RH** (9–12 months).
- Use ethambutol (adults) or aminoglycoside (children).
- Add adjunctive corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone tapered over 6–8 weeks).

## 2.6 Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

### 2.6.1 Magnitude
- MDR-TB prevalence (2010 survey):
  - New TB patients: 1.4%
  - Previously treated: 12.1% rifampicin resistance, 21.1% isoniazid resistance.

### 2.6.2 Definition
- **Mono-resistance**: One first-line drug.
- **Poly-resistance**: >1 first-line drug (not H+R).
- **MDR-TB**: Resistant to at least H and R.
- **Pre-XDR-TB**: MDR plus resistance to FQ or injectable (not both).
- **XDR-TB**: MDR plus resistance to FQ and injectable.

### 2.6.3 Risk Factors
- Inadequate treatment due to:
  - **Health system**: Poor DOT, wrong regimens, lack of monitoring.
  - **Drug factors**: Stock-outs, poor quality, improper storage.
  - **Patient factors**: Poor adherence, alcohol/substance abuse, malabsorption, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes).

### 2.6.4 Diagnosis
- Suspect DR-TB in:
  - Contacts of DR-TB
  - Relapse, failure, or loss to follow-up
  - Smear-positive at 2–3 months on first-line treatment
  - HIV-positive presumptive TB
  - HCWs, prisoners
- Test with Xpert MTB/RIF or LPA.
- Confirm with culture and DST.

### 2.6.5 Treatment
- Initiated by DR-TB Expert Review Panels.

- **Standard regimen (20–24 months)**: For complex cases.
- **Phases**:
  - Intensive: ≥6 months (injectable + 4 oral drugs)
  - Continuation: 12–14 months (4 oral drugs)

### 2.6.6 Anti-TB Drug Groups (for DR-TB)

  1. Choose injectable (Group B).
  2. Add FQ (Group A).
  3. Add ≥2 Group C drugs.
  4. Add Group D1 drugs (Z, E).
  5. Add Group D2/D3 if needed.

### 2.6.8 Monitoring MDR-TB Treatment
- **Clinical**: Symptom improvement, weight gain (children).
- **Bacteriological**: Monthly smear and culture until conversion (2 consecutive negatives ≥30 days apart).
- **Radiological**: CXR every 6 months or if clinically indicated.

## 2.7 Tuberculosis in Children

### 2.7.1 Introduction
- Children account for ~7.5% of TB cases in Uganda (underreported; estimated 15–20%).
- Higher risk of infection, disease, and severe forms (e.g., TB meningitis) due to immature immunity.
- Mainly primary TB; older children may have reactivation disease.

### 2.7.2 Risk Factors
- **Infection**: Close/prolonged contact with infectious TB case; high community prevalence.
- **Disease**: Age <5 years (especially <2), HIV, severe malnutrition, measles/pertussis, immunosuppression.
- **Severe disease**: Age <1 year, no BCG vaccination.

### 2.7.3 Presentation (Presumptive TB if any of the following)
- Persistent cough ≥2 weeks
- Prolonged fever ≥2 weeks
- Poor weight gain ≥1 month (weight loss, MUAC in red zone, flattening growth curve)
- Household contact with PTB
- Reduced playfulness/poor feeding with above symptoms

### 2.7.4 Diagnosis
- Seek bacteriological confirmation (Xpert preferred).
- **Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)**:
  - Positive if ≥5 mm in HIV+, malnourished, or immunosuppressed children.
  - Positive if ≥10 mm in other children.

### 2.7.5 Treatment
- **New TB (excluding meningitis/bone)**: **2RHZE/4RH**
- **TB meningitis or bone TB**: **2RHZE/10RH**
- **Dosing (by weight)**:
  - H: 10 mg/kg (7–15)
  - R: 15 mg/kg (10–20)
  - Z: 35 mg/kg (30–40)
  - E: 20 mg/kg (15–25)
- Streptomycin not recommended in children.
- Use FDCs by weight band (4–7 kg: 1 tablet; 8–11 kg: 2; 12–15 kg: 3; 16–24 kg: 4; ≥25 kg: adult doses).

### 2.7.6 Adjunct Therapy
- **Pyridoxine**: 12.5–25 mg/day for HIV+ or malnourished children.
- **Prednisolone**: 2 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks (TB meningitis or airway obstruction), then taper.

### 2.7.7 Follow-Up
- Every 2 weeks in first month, then monthly.
- Weigh at each visit; adjust dose.
- Monitor for adherence, hepatitis, and opportunistic infections (if HIV+).
- CXR not needed if responding well.

### 2.7.8 Prevention
- **BCG**: Given at birth; protects against severe TB (not in confirmed HIV+ infants).
- **IPT**: 6 months for:
  - All children <5 years with TB contact
  - All HIV+ children (after excluding active TB)
- **Contact screening**: Prioritize contacts of bacteriologically confirmed PTB, MDR-TB, PLHIV, and children <5 years.

### 2.7.9 TB/HIV Co-infection in Children
- Start TB treatment immediately.
- Start ART within 2–8 weeks of TB treatment start.
- **ART regimens**:
  - **<3 years**: AZT+3TC+ABC (preferred); ABC+3TC+NVP (alternative)
  - **≥3 years**: ABC+3TC+EFV or TDF+3TC+EFV
- If already on ART:
  - Substitute NVP with EFV if on NVP-based regimen.
  - Continue if on EFV or triple NRTI.

### 2.7.10 TB Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)
- Worsening TB symptoms within 3 months of ART start.
- Risk factors: low CD4, extensive TB, early ART.
- **Management**:
  - Continue TB and ART.
  - Give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 1–2 weeks, then taper.
  - Rule out treatment failure or other infections.

## 2.8 TB/HIV Co-infection

### 2.8.1 Introduction
- HIV is the strongest risk factor for TB (20–37x higher risk).
- TB causes ~27% of HIV-related adult deaths, ~30% in children.
- In Uganda, ~45% of TB patients are HIV+.

### 2.8.2 TB Prevention in HIV
- **Intensified Case Finding (ICF)**: Screen all PLHIV at every visit using 4-symptom tool.
- **IPT**: Offer to all PLHIV after excluding active TB.
- **Infection Control**: Implement in all health facilities and congregate settings.

### 2.8.3 HIV Care in TB Clinics
- **Provider-Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC)**: Offer to all presumptive/diagnosed TB patients.
- **Co-trimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT)**: Give to all HIV+ TB patients, regardless of CD4.
- **ART**: Start in all HIV+ TB patients; begin within 8 weeks of TB treatment.

### 2.8.4 Community Involvement
- Engage VHTs, support groups, and CBOs in:
  - Case finding
  - Treatment support (DOT, ART adherence)
  - Reducing stigma

### 2.8.5 Presentation of TB in HIV
- **Early HIV**: Similar to HIV– (cavitation, smear-positive).
- **Late HIV**: Atypical (infiltrates without cavitation, smear-negative, extra-pulmonary, disseminated).

### 2.8.6 Diagnosis in HIV
- Use Xpert MTB/RIF as initial test.
- Consider urine LAM in seriously ill or CD4 ≤100.
- CXR often atypical; clinical judgment critical.

### 2.8.7 TB Treatment in HIV
- Same regimens as HIV– patients.
- Ensure DOT and adherence support.
- Start ART within 8 weeks of TB treatment.

### 2.8.8 TB-ART Co-treatment Regimens
- **Adults**: TDF+3TC+EFV or AZT+3TC+EFV
- **Children <3 years**: AZT+3TC+ABC
- **Children ≥3 years**: ABC+3TC+EFV
- **Note**: Avoid NVP with rifampicin (use EFV instead).

### 2.8.9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS)
- Paradoxical worsening after ART start.
- **Management**: Continue TB/ART; prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, then taper.

## 2.9 Tuberculosis Infection Control (TB IC)

### 2.9.1 Introduction
- TB spreads via airborne droplet nuclei (<5 µm).
- Most infectious: untreated smear-positive pulmonary or laryngeal TB.

### 2.9.2 TB IC Measures (Hierarchy)
1. **Administrative controls** (highest priority):
   - Prompt identification, isolation, and treatment of presumptive TB.
   - Cough hygiene education.
   - Fast-track TB suspects in clinics.
2. **Environmental controls**:
   - Natural ventilation (open windows/doors).
   - Bed spacing ≥2.5 m (head-to-foot arrangement).
