*Source: WHO - https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis*
*Last updated: March 14, 2025*

## Key Facts

• A total of **1.25 million people died** from tuberculosis (TB) in 2023 (including 161,000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB has probably returned to being the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following three years in which it was replaced by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

• In 2023, an estimated **10.8 million people fell ill with TB** worldwide, including 6.0 million men, 3.6 million women and 1.3 million children. TB is present in all countries and age groups. **TB is curable and preventable**.

• **Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)** remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2023.

• Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated **79 million lives** since the year 2000.

• **US$ 22 billion** is needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve the global target by 2027 agreed at the 2023 UN high level-meeting on TB.

• Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Overview

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most often affects the lungs. It spreads through the air when people with TB cough, sneeze or spit.

**Tuberculosis is preventable and curable.**

About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease.

Those who are infected but free of disease cannot transmit it. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment.

In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents deaths from TB and protects children from serious forms of TB.

### Risk Factors

Certain conditions can increase a person's risk for TB disease:

• Diabetes (high blood sugar)
• Weakened immune system (for example, from HIV or AIDS)
• Being malnourished
• Tobacco use
• Harmful use of alcohol

## Symptoms

People with TB infection don't feel sick and aren't contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk.

TB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Some people with TB disease do not have any symptoms.

### Common symptoms of TB:

• **Prolonged cough** (sometimes with blood)
• **Chest pain**
• **Weakness**
• **Fatigue**
• **Weight loss**
• **Fever**
• **Night sweats**

The symptoms people get depend on which part of the body is affected by TB. While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and skin.

## Prevention

Follow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread:

• **Seek medical attention** if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss as early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery.

• **Get tested for TB** if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people who have TB in your household or workplace.

• **TB preventive treatment (TPT)** prevents infection from becoming disease. If prescribed TPT, complete the full course.

• **Practice good hygiene** when coughing, including avoiding contact with other people and wearing a mask, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of sputum and used tissues properly.

• **Special measures** like respirators and ventilation are important to reduce infection in healthcare facilities and other institutions.

## Diagnosis

WHO recommends the use of **rapid molecular diagnostic tests** as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB.

### Recommended Tests:

• **Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra** and **Truenat assays** - These tests have high diagnostic accuracy and will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.

• **Tuberculin skin test (TST)**, **interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)** or newer **antigen-based skin tests (TBST)** can be used to identify people with infection.

Diagnosing multidrug-resistant and other resistant forms of TB as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive. Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children.

## Treatment

Tuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.

### Most common antibiotics used:

• **Isoniazid**
• **Rifampicin**
• **Pyrazinamide**
• **Ethambutol**

To be effective, medications need to be taken daily for **4–6 months**. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice as it can prompt TB bacteria in the body to become resistant to the drugs.

TB that doesn't respond to standard drugs is called **drug-resistant TB** and requires treatment with different medicines.

## Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)

Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely.

**MDR-TB** is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and toxic.

In some cases, **extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB)** can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective drugs in MDR-TB treatment regimens can leave patients with very limited treatment options.

### New Treatment Options (2022)

WHO guidelines prioritized a short **6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL** as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2023, 5,646 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have been started treatment on the BPaLM/BPaL regimen, up from 1,744 in 2022.

## TB and HIV

People living with HIV are **16 times more likely** to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.

HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each speeding the other's progress. In 2023, about **161,000 people died of HIV-associated TB**.

• The percentage of notified TB patients who had a documented HIV test result in 2023 was **80%**
• The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB
• Only **56% of TB patients** known to be living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2023

WHO recommends a **12-component approach** of collaborative TB-HIV activities, including actions for prevention and treatment of infection and disease, to reduce deaths.

## Global Impact

TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over **80% of cases and deaths** are in low- and middle-income countries.

### Geographic Distribution (2023):

• **WHO South-East Asia Region**: 45% of new cases
• **African Region**: 24% of new cases  
• **Western Pacific Region**: 17% of new cases
• **87% of new TB cases** occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries
• More than **two-thirds of the global total** in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines

### Financial Impact:

Globally, about **50% of people treated for TB** and their households face total costs that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income), far from the WHO End TB Strategy target of zero.

### Attributable Cases (2023):

• **0.96 million** new TB cases attributable to undernutrition
• **0.75 million** to alcohol use disorders
• **0.70 million** to smoking
• **0.61 million** to HIV infection
• **0.38 million** to diabetes

## Investments to End TB

**US$ 22 billion** are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets by 2027 agreed on at the 2023 UN high level-TB meeting.

### Funding Sources:

• **80% of spending** on TB services in 2023 was from domestic sources
• In low- and middle-income countries, international donor funding remains crucial
• From 2019 to 2023: **decline of US$ 1.2 billion** in domestic funding and **slight increase of US$ 0.1 billion** in international donor funding
• Financing for TB research and innovation at **US$ 1.0 billion in 2022** falls far short of the global target of **US$ 5 billion per year**

## WHO Response

WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society in scaling up the TB response through six core functions:

1. **Global Leadership**: Strategy development, political and multisectoral engagement, strengthening review and accountability, advocacy, and partnerships

2. **Research and Innovation**: Shaping the TB research agenda and stimulating knowledge generation and dissemination

3. **Standards Setting**: Setting norms and standards on TB prevention and care and promoting their implementation

4. **Policy Development**: Developing ethical and evidence-based policy options for TB prevention and care

5. **Technical Support**: Providing specialized support to Member States and partners, catalysing change, and building sustainable capacity

6. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Tracking the status of the TB epidemic and progress in financing and implementation at global, regional and country levels

# Treating Tuberculosis (CDC Guidelines)

*Source: CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/tb/treatment/index.html*
*Last updated: April 17, 2025*

## Key Points

• Both **inactive tuberculosis (TB)** (also called latent TB infection) and **active TB disease** can be treated.

• It is important to take and finish all TB medicines exactly as your health care provider recommends.

• Completing treatment for inactive TB and active TB disease can protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community.

## Treatment Overview

Not everyone infected with TB germs becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: **inactive TB** and **active TB disease**. Both inactive TB and active TB disease can be treated.

Even though you may not feel sick, inactive TB can develop into active TB disease at any time and make you sick. If you have inactive TB, treating it is the best way to protect you from getting sick with active TB disease. If you have active TB disease, you can be treated with medicine.

TB germs are strong, and it can take a long time for them to die. It is important to take and finish all TB medicines exactly as your health care provider recommends.

## Treatment Options

There are several safe and effective treatment plans recommended in the United States for inactive TB and active TB disease. A treatment plan (also called treatment regimen) includes:

• The types of TB medicines to take
• How much TB medicine to take  
• How often to take the TB medicines
• How long to take the medicines
• How to monitor yourself for any side effects
• The health care provider(s) who will support you through the treatment process

### Inactive TB

Treatment for inactive TB can take **three, four, six, or nine months** depending on the treatment plan.

The treatment plans for inactive TB use different combinations of medicines that may include:

• **Isoniazid**
• **Rifampin** 
• **Rifapentine**

### Active TB Disease

Treatment for active TB disease can take **four, six, or nine months** depending on the treatment plan.

The treatment plans for active TB disease use different combinations of medicines that may include:

• **Ethambutol**
• **Isoniazid**
• **Moxifloxacin**
• **Rifampin**
• **Rifapentine**
• **Pyrazinamide**

### Drug-Resistant TB Disease

There are several treatment plans for drug-resistant TB disease depending on what medicines the TB germs are resistant to. Treating and curing drug-resistant TB disease is complicated and should be treated by a TB medical expert.

People with drug-resistant TB disease must be treated with special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years, and the medicines can cause side effects.

## Before Starting Treatment

### Important Considerations:

**Tell your health care provider about all medicines you are taking:**
• Some medicines can interact with TB medicines and cause side effects
• Some oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may not work as well when taken with TB medicines

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**
Tell your health care provider if you are or think you may be pregnant, or are breastfeeding before starting any TB medicines.

**Alcohol Warning:**
Drinking alcoholic beverages while taking medicines for inactive TB or active TB disease can be dangerous and may hurt your liver.

## Side Effects

Most people can take their TB medicines without any problems. However, like all medicines, TB medicines can have side effects. People react differently to medicines.

### Minor Side Effects:

• **Skin rash** - Any TB medicine can cause this
• **Upset stomach or nausea** - Taking TB medicine with food can help
• **Orange-colored body fluids** - Rifampin or rifapentine may cause urine, saliva, tears, sweat, and breast milk to turn orange (this is normal and harmless)

### Serious Side Effects (Call your health care provider immediately):

• **Liver injury:**
  - Abdominal pain
  - Nausea and vomiting  
  - Skin and eyes turning yellow (jaundice)
• **Dizziness or lightheadedness**
• **Loss of appetite**
• **Flu-like symptoms**
• **Tingling or numbness in hands or feet**

*Note: If taking isoniazid, your provider may add vitamin B6 to prevent tingling/numbness.*

## Special Considerations

### Children
There are several treatments available for children with inactive TB or active TB disease. Health care providers will consider a child's age, weight, and other factors when prescribing treatment.

### People with HIV
There are several treatment options for people with HIV who have inactive TB or TB disease. Your health care provider will choose TB medicines that are recommended for people with HIV.

### Pregnant Women
If you are pregnant, your health care provider will choose TB medicines that are recommended for use during pregnancy and will monitor you and your baby during treatment.

## Completing Treatment

### Take All TB Medicines Exactly as Prescribed

Do not miss any doses and do not stop treatment early. It can be very dangerous to stop taking your medicines or not to take all your medicines regularly.

### Treatment Monitoring Options

#### Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) - Recommended Method
• Meet with a health care worker every day or several times a week
• Meetings may be in-person or virtual (through smartphone, tablet, or computer)
• Health care worker watches you take your TB medicines
• Ensures medicines are working as they should

#### Self-Administered Treatment Tips:
• Take pills at the same time every day
• Set an alarm as a reminder
• Write yourself reminder notes
• Ask family/friends to remind you
• Mark off each day on a calendar
• Use a weekly pill dispenser
• Use medication tracker tools

### Health Care Provider Monitoring

Your health care provider will:
• Ask about side effects
• Perform tests to see how medicines are working
• Request blood, sputum, or urine tests during treatment
• Order additional chest x-rays if treating active TB disease

### Keep Treatment Records

Ask your health care provider for a written record that you have completed treatment. This will be helpful if you need another TB test in the future.

### Future Protection

Most healthy people will not need to be treated for TB ever again. However, if you are around someone with active TB disease, there is a chance you can get new TB germs in your body.

## Getting Support

### If You Need Additional Assistance:

**Talk to your health care provider** - They may share resources with you, and state/local TB programs may provide support.

**Ask family or friends for support** - They can help you remember to take medicines and provide emotional support.

**Connect with other TB survivors:**
• [We are TB](https://www.wearetb.com/) - Community of TB survivors and their families
• [Somos TB](https://www.wearetb.com/somostb) - For Spanish-speakers
• [CDC Tuberculosis Personal Stories](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/stories/index.html)

### Financial Assistance

Public and private health care plans may cover the costs of treatment for inactive TB or active TB disease.

- **Josephine Nabayinda** - Makerere University Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration, Uganda  
- **Proscovia Nabunyab** - Makerere University Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration, Uganda
- **Fred M Ssewamala** - Washington University, USA

## Key Points

### TB-HIV Burden in Uganda

• **Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death** among people living with HIV, responsible for over one-third of all HIV-related deaths worldwide

• **Uganda is one of the 30 high-burden tuberculosis–HIV countries** in the world, with an annual tuberculosis incidence ranging between **200-350 cases per 100,000 people**

• **TB-HIV co-infection rate: 40%** - HIV is the biggest driver of tuberculosis in Uganda

• **Treatment completion crisis**: Up to half (10-50%) of all patients with tuberculosis in high-burden countries, including Uganda, do not complete treatment

• **Poor treatment outcomes**: Treatment success rate for TB-HIV co-infected patients is only **70%**

### Treatment Challenges

**Patient Loss Statistics:**
- **13% of tuberculosis patients** are lost to follow-up
- **20% of patients** diagnosed with tuberculosis do not initiate treatment
- **Adherence gap**: TB medication adherence lags behind antiretroviral therapy adherence, even within the same patient

**Contributing Factors:**
- Prolonged infectivity
- Drug resistance development
- Disease relapse
- Prolonged morbidity
- Preventable deaths

## The Poverty Factor

### Financial Impact on Households

**Catastrophic Healthcare Expenditure:**
- **53.1% of TB patient households** in Uganda face catastrophic expenditure
- Patients spend **20-40% of household income** on tuberculosis care
- **Average cost**: US$369 per episode for drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment
- **Higher costs for TB-HIV co-infected patients** due to simultaneous HIV-associated costs

### Access Barriers

**Geographic and Economic Challenges:**
- Many health facilities do not offer tuberculosis treatment services
- Patients incur **high transport costs** to access distant clinics
- Only **3.9% of TB patients** receive social protection support for financial constraints

## Research Gap and Call to Action

### Current Research Limitations

**Poverty under-prioritized:**
- Very few studies test interventions that target household poverty in patients with HIV and tuberculosis
- Limited focus on social determinants of health in TB-HIV research

### Policy Alignment

**WHO Global Plan Consistency:**
- Addressing household poverty aligns with WHO global plan to **end tuberculosis as a public health challenge by 2030**

**Uganda's National Strategic Goals:**
- Achieve **more than 90% tuberculosis treatment success**
- Ensure **no patient with tuberculosis and their household experience catastrophic costs** due to tuberculosis

### Research Recommendation

**Call for Action:**
The authors call on **HIV-tuberculosis researchers to prioritize addressing poverty** as a key intervention target in research studies.

## Clinical Implications

### Treatment Success Factors

**Beyond Medical Treatment:**
- Medical interventions alone insufficient for optimal outcomes
- **Social determinants** (especially poverty) must be addressed
- Need for **integrated approaches** combining medical and socioeconomic interventions

### Policy Considerations

**Healthcare System Improvements Needed:**
- Expand tuberculosis treatment services to more health facilities
- Implement comprehensive social protection programs
- Address geographic accessibility barriers
- Develop poverty-targeted interventions

## Global Context

### High-Burden Countries

**Similar Challenges Worldwide:**
- Uganda's experience likely representative of other high TB-HIV burden countries
- **Social determinants approach** needed globally
- Importance of addressing **structural factors** affecting treatment outcomes

### Research Priorities

**Future Study Directions:**
- Poverty-targeted interventions in TB-HIV research
- Household economic support programs
- Transportation assistance programs
- Integrated social protection schemes

## Conclusion

This correspondence highlights the critical role of poverty as a driver of poor HIV and tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Uganda. The authors emphasize that despite medical advances, **social determinants of health—particularly poverty—remain inadequately addressed** in TB-HIV research and interventions.

**Key Message:** Achieving the WHO goal of ending tuberculosis by 2030 requires research and interventions that go beyond medical treatment to address the underlying social and economic factors that perpetuate poor treatment outcomes.
