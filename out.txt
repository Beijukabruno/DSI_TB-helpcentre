The revision of the third edition of the national tuberculosis and leprosy manual was facilitated 
by  United  States  Agency  for  International  development  (USAID)  through  TRACK  TB  Project 
managed by Management Sciences for Health. In addition, the following organizations supported 
the  revision  of  the  manual:  Uganda  Health  Supply  Chain  (UHSC)  and  Clinton  Health  Access 
Initiative (CHAI) 

The following individuals were involved directly in the revision of the sections indicated against 
their names: Dr. Frank Mugabe (Introduction and description of NTLP), Dr. William Worodria 
(Drug  Resistant  TB),  Dr.  Moorine  Sekadde  (TB  in  children),  Dr.  Sam  Kasozi  (Drug  Resistant 
TB,  Infection  control  and  IPT),  Dr.  Simon  Walusimbi  (TB/HIV  co-infection)  and  Dr.  Aldo 
Burua  (TB  Monitoring  and  Evaluation).  The  Leprosy  section  was  written  by  Dr.  Joseph 
Kawuma. 

The  following  people  in  addition  to  those  directly  involved  in  the  development  of  the  manual, 
participated  in  the  technical  and  stakeholders  meetings  to  review  the  document  and  provided 
invaluable comments: Dr. Mugabe Frank. R, Dr. Mabumba Eldard, Dr. Stavia Turyahabwe, Dr. 
Upenytho  George  and  Dr.  Ebony  Quinto  from  NTLP,  Dr.  Moorine  Sekadde  (NTLP/Baylor-
Uganda), Raymond  Asiimwe (NTLP/NTRL), Dr. Aldo Burua (NTLP/TRACK TB), Dr.  Simon 
Muchuro  (NTLP/TRACK  TB),  Dr.  Claudio  Mara  (NTLP/USAID)  and  Hawa  Nakato 
(NTLP/UHSC).  The  other  people  include  Juliet  Kitutu  (UHSC),  Dr.  Victor  Musime  and  Sam 
Acelam  from  CHAI  and  Dr.  Eric  Wobudeya  from  Mulago  National  Referral  Hospital.  The 
regional  and  district  representatives  who  participated  in  the  review  meetings  are  also 
acknowledged   

The following individuals are also acknowledged for providing expert review of the manual and 
thus  provided  invaluable  input  in  to  the  revision  of  the  NTLP  manual:  Dr.  Joseph  Imoko,  Dr. 
Abel  Nkolo  (WHO),  Dr.  Anna  Nakanwagi  (The  Union)  and  Dr.  Giuliano  Gargioni  (WHO, 
Geneva) 

The  overall  revision  of  the  NTLP  manual  was  led  by  Dr.  Bruce  J.  Kirenga  from  Makerere 
University  College  of  Health  Sciences  and  Dr.  Kawuma  Joseph  from  German  Leprosy  Relief 
Association (GLRA) and coordinated by Dr. Aldo Burua from MSH/TRACK TB project.

FOREWORD 

Uganda, like other Sub-Saharan countries, continues to identify thousands of tuberculosis (TB) 
cases  (43,858 TB patients  of all types were notified in  2015/16),  yet  these are only half of the 
estimated  TB  cases.  The  recent  national  TB  prevalence  survey  conducted  in  2014/15  found  a 
much higher TB burden (prevalence of 253/100,000 population), than was previously estimated. 
This highlights the task ahead for Uganda to achieve the new ambitious global target of ending 
tuberculosis by the year 2035. Uganda has also made significant progress in leprosy control. The 
country  already  achieved  the  target  of  elimination  of  leprosy  as  a  public  health  problem. 
However,  several  new  cases  of  leprosy  continue  to  be  notified  annually.  Many  of  these  have 
established disabilities and a significant proportion are children.  

One of the key factors in the success of Uganda in TB and leprosy control is standardization of 
TB control activities through publication of guidelines for TB and leprosy control. One of these 
guidelines is the Tuberculosis and Leprosy Manual. The manual contains updated information on 
the structure and functions of the NTLP, basic biology of the two diseases, diagnostic pathways, 
management  strategies,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  manual  also  contains  chapters  on 
special issues in TB and leprosy.  

This revised manual comes at a time when the world has just changed its approach from stopping 
TB  to  ending  TB.  There  is  now  global  commitment  to  end  TB  in  the  new  strategy  called  the 
“End TB strategy”. The Ministry of Health is making plans to adopt this global TB strategy to 
end  TB.    This  manual  comes  at  a  time  the  NTLP  has  undertaken  to  revise  the  strategic  plan 
2015/16-2019/20,  to  incorporate strategies to  address  the  expanded TB  burden  and incorporate 
components of the WHO End TB strategy. The manual therefore introduces these global targets 
concepts along the traditional practices in TB and leprosy control. 

Although  the  manual  is  written  to  meet  local  needs,  it  is  written  in  line  with  international 
guidelines, specifically those of the World Health Organization (WHO). The current 3rd edition 
of the manual has been improved by including pictures and information boxes to facilitate easy 
grasp of the key principles and practices in TB and leprosy control. 

The Ministry of Health is strongly committed to TB and leprosy control. I congratulate the NTLP 
and stakeholders on this achievement and strongly recommend this manual to all involved in TB 
and Leprosy prevention and care in Uganda and beyond.

PREFACE 

Understanding  the  operations  of  the  National  TB/Leprosy  Program  is  paramount  for  efficient 
delivery  of  services  by  first  line  health  workers  as  well  as  TB/Leprosy  focal  points  at  district 
level and their supervisors. 

During  the  last  four  years  following  the  dissemination  of  the  2nd  edition  of  the  NTLP  Manual 
significant developments have taken place in the areas of: 

  Alignment of the NTLP operations to the mainstream Ministry of Health (MOH) regional 

structure 

Implementation of community based TB care 

  Programmatic management of drug resistant TB 
  Use of new diagnostic tools  
 
  Diagnosis and management of pediatric TB 
  The management of TB/HIV co-infection 
  Monitoring and evaluation of the program 

While  leprosy  control  has  been  sustained,  there  are  challenges  in  reducing  the  burden  to  even 
lower levels in the context of the scattered high burden sites or “hot spots” in an otherwise low 
endemic  setting  and  the  dwindling  knowledge  about  leprosy  in  the  community  as  well  as  the 
health service providers. 

This revised manual provides an update on those and other areas and pays special attention to the 
key role of the district TB/leprosy supervisors (DTLS). It provides guidance on how the district 
TB  and  leprosy  supervisor  (DTLS)  function  relates  to  the  health  facility  staff  on  the  one  hand 
and the health service managers at the district, regional and national levels on the other. The lay 
out has been modified to enrich the indicated areas. 

Effort has been made to  align the national  TB strategic plan (NSP)  to  the MOH Health Sector 
Development Plan and to the relevant World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. 

The manual should be a ready reference for the various service providers but also serve to meet 
the needs of any other people with a stake in the care of tuberculosis and leprosy patients as well 
as the provision of preventive services.

INTRODUCTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE NTLP 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1.1 Geography and Demography 

Uganda is  a land locked country located in  East  Africa bordered by  South Sudan in  the north, 
Kenya in the east, Tanzania and Rwanda in the south and Democratic Republic of Congo in the 
West. It covers a surface area of 241,038 Km2. The capital city is Kampala with English as the 
official language. Uganda's climate is typically tropical with two rainy and two dry seasons.  

The  2014  national  census  estimated  the  population  of  Uganda  to  be  34.9  million  people,  with 
about  half  of  the  population  below  15  years.  About  82  percent  of  the  population  lives  in  rural 
areas, while 18 percent live in urban areas. The life expectancy at birth is 63.3 years (men 62.2, 
women 64.2, up from  50.4  years in  2002).  Infant  and under-five mortality rates  are 53  and 80 
deaths per 1,000 live births respectively (UBOS, 2014). The maternal mortality ratio decreased 
from 438 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2011(UDHS, 2011) to 360 maternal deaths 
per 100,000 live births in 2013 (WHO, 2015)  

1.1.2 Health Service delivery 

Health services are provided by the public and private sectors with each covering about 50% of 
the population (HSSIP-3). The public sector consists of the Central Government of Uganda and 
local  governments.  The  private  sector  consists  of  Faith  based  and  NGO  private  not  for  profit 
(PNFP) organizations, private for profit providers and traditional and complementary medicine 
practitioners.  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MoH)  is  a  government  body  responsible  for  policy 
formulation, resource mobilization and technical guidance on health matters in Uganda.  

1.1.3 Burden of Tuberculosis  

The National TB prevalence survey conducted in 2015 puts the incidence of TB at 234/100,000 
population for all TB cases and prevalence of TB is 253/100,000 population. The survey further 
showed that about 24% of TB patients are HIV co-infected. Based on the 2015 global TB report, 
the  mortality  rate  from  TB  (excluding  HIV  positive  TB)  in  2014  was  estimated  at  12/100,000 
population. Multidrug resistant TB is an emerging problem with more than 1,040 estimated cases 
every year and the actual case finding is around 200 cases per year.   

1.1.4 Burden of Leprosy 

The elimination of leprosy as a public health problem which was first attained in 2004 has been 
sustained at national level. Since 2014 elimination has also been achieved at regional and district 
levels. However, in some districts, there are still leprosy hot spots with unusually high numbers 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        1 

 
of new cases. Less than half of districts had at least one patient registered for treatment at the end 
of  2015.  Leprosy  has  not  yet  been  eradicated.  All  districts  need  to  maintain  a  surveillance 
system. New leprosy case detection rate per 100,000 population has decreased from 1.12 in 2008 
to 0.7 in 2015. About 5% of new cases were children under 15 years of age. The proportion of 
new cases with visible (Grade 2) disabilities at the time of detection was 25% in 2015. There are 
an estimated 2000 leprosy affected persons living with medical and social rehabilitation needs. 

1.2 THE NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS AND LEPROSY PROGRAM 

The NTLP, is a disease control program under the department of National Disease Control of the 
Ministry of Health (MoH). The NTLP is charged with performing the national core function of 
TB and Leprosy control through;  
1) Establishment of country wide facilities for quality diagnosis and treatment of TB and leprosy;  
2) Coordination and supervision of the implementation of TB and leprosy prevention and care   
3) Prevention and management of leprosy-related disabilities. 

The NTLP follows internationally accepted strategies of TB control. WHO has now designed a 
new  strategy  called  the  End  TB  strategy.  This  strategy  was  adopted  by  the  67th  World  Health 
Assembly on May 19, 2014. The NTLP revised its strategic plan for 2015-16/2019-20, to address 
the findings of the recent TB prevalence survey that reported a much higher TB burden than was 
previously  estimated.  The  revision  also  aimed  at  incorporating  the  components  of  the  End  TB 
strategy which provides a unified response to end TB deaths, disease, and suffering. The strategy 
has three pillars and 10 components, and is based on four principles. 

Pillar 1: integrated, patient centred care and prevention 

Components 

A.  Early  diagnosis  of  TB  including  universal  drug  susceptibility  testing,  and  systematic 

screening of contacts and high risk groups 

B.  Treatment of all people with TB including drug resistant TB, and patient support 
C.  Collaborative TB/HIV activities; and management of comorbidities  
D.   Preventive treatment of persons at high risk; and vaccination against TB 

Pillar 2: Bold policies and supportive systems  

Components 

A.  Political commitment with adequate resources for TB care and prevention 
B.  Engagement of communities, civil society and all public and private care providers 
C.  Universal  health  coverage  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  case  notification,  vital 

registration, quality and rational use of medicines, and infection control 

D.  Social protection, poverty alleviation and actions on other determinants of TB 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        2 

 
 
 
Pillar 3: Intensified research and innovations  

Components 

A.  Discovery, development and rapid uptake of new tools, interventions and strategies 
B.  Research to optimize implementation and impact and promote innovations 

The leprosy control strategy: 

A new global leprosy strategy for 2016-2020 has been set. The Global  Leprosy Strategy 2016-
2020:  Accelerating  towards  a  leprosy-free  world  has  the  goal  to  further  reduce  the  burden  of 
leprosy at the global and local level.  

The Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-2020 is also based on three pillars:   
1. Strengthening government ownership, coordination and partnership 
2. Stopping leprosy and its complications 
3. Stopping discrimination and promoting inclusion  

1.2.1 Organisation structure of the NTLP 

NTLP  is  headed  by  a  Program  Manager  and  several  program  officers  who  coordinate  the 
different activities within NTLP. A new structure for NTLP has been proposed. In this structure 
which is yet to be approved NTLP will have a central unit headed by the Program Manager and 
supported  by  a  number  of  officers  who  coordinate  the  following  units:  Prevention  and  Health 
promotion,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation,  Care  and  Treatment  services,  Laboratory  Services,  and 
Policy and Regional TB and Leprosy services. Under the above units, there are focal officers for 
specific program functions (Annex 1). 

At the regional level, management and supervision of TB and Leprosy services is performed by 
the  Regional  TB  and  Leprosy  focal  Person  (RTLP).  There  are  currently  12  regions  which  are 
aligned to the 12 MoH Regional performance monitoring teams (RPMT) structure. At the district 
level,  the  District  Health  Officer  (DHO)  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  health  service 
delivery including TB and Leprosy prevention and care. The DHO assigns a district health team 
member as District TB and Leprosy Supervisor (DTLS) with responsibility of overseeing TB and 
Leprosy care and prevention services in the district.   

At  the  Health  Sub-district  level  (HSD),  the  in-charge  of  the  HSD  is  responsible  for  the 
management of health service delivery including TB and Leprosy care and prevention services. 
A health worker is assigned the responsibility of overseeing TB and Leprosy care and prevention 
services at the HSD level and this person is referred to as the Health Sub-district Focal Person.  

At  the  district,  HSD  and  health  facility  level,  TB  and  Leprosy  care  and  prevention 
services/services  are  integrated  into  the  general  health  services.  Table  1.1  summarizes  the 
responsibilities in the proposed structure:

SECTION TWO 

TUBERCULOSIS 

2.1 TUBERULOSIS DISEASE 

2.1.1 Causative organism 

Tuberculosis  (TB)  is  usually  caused  by  a  bacterium,  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  (M.tb) 
complex  (such  as  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  Mycobacterium  bovis,  Mycobacterium 
africanum  and  Mycobacterium  microti).  In  clinical  and  laboratory  settings,  these  bacteria  are 
also  referred  to  conventionally  as  tubercle  bacilli  (because  they  cause  lesions  in  tissues  called 
tubercles)  or  acid-fast  bacilli  (AFB),  because  they  retain  a  red  dye  after  washing  with  alcohol 
following staining. In few cases mycobacterium bovis that causes TB in animals can cause TB 
among humans. However, the most common cause is myc. tuberculosis. 

2.1.2 Transmission 

Transmission of tubercle bacilli occurs when a patient suffering from pulmonary TB who is not 
on  effective  treatment  expels  into  the  environment  air  containing  droplets  with  the  bacilli 
(coughing, singing or sneezing). The liquid in the droplets evaporates leaving the droplet nuclei 
containing  the  bacilli.  The  droplet  nuclei  are  small  enough  to  be  inhaled  into  the  lungs  and 
deposited into the alveoli. Transmission is easier in the following situations: 

  Closed environment where ventilation is poor.  
  High number of TB bacilli in the sputum 
  Close  contact  over  a  prolonged  period  with  a  pulmonary  TB  sputum  smear-positive 
patient who is not yet on treatment increases the chance of becoming infected with M.tb. 

  Duration of exposure to the infectious source 
  High prevalence of TB in the community 

On the other hand, the chance of getting infection is low if the contact is occasional or the patient 
has extra-pulmonary TB. 

2.1.3 Infection and Development of TB Disease 

When  transmission  of  tubercle  bacilli  takes  place  and  the  person  is  infected  for  the  first  time 
ever, it is called primary infection. Tubercle bacilli multiply in the lungs and lymphatic organs 
and  causes  lymph  node  enlargement  in  the  chest.  The  tubercle  bacilli  may  also  spread  from 
lymphatic organs through blood to other parts of the body. This process takes 6-8 weeks. At the 
end  of  6-8  weeks,  immunity  is  developed  in  up  to  90  percent  of  persons  who  get  primary 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        5 

 
 
infection.  This  immunity  then  controls  the  further  multiplication  and  spread  of  the  tubercle 
bacilli, and the person recovers (figure 2.1).  

However, tubercle bacilli have a special ability to remain dormant for long periods. This is the 
situation in 90 percent of these infected persons. Under normal conditions, these infected persons 
can be recognized by being tuberculin (Mantoux) positive and the new TB infection tests.  

The immunity of about 10 percent of people, however, may be too low to contain infection at the 
time of primary infection. These persons develop disease as a direct result of primary infection. 
Such  disease  is  referred  to  as  primary  disease  because  it  is  a  direct  progression  of  primary 
infection. This may occur in conditions like HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cancer, 
and use of immunosuppressive drugs, malnutrition, advancing age and many others. When such 
a  situation  arises,  the  previously  dormant  tubercle  bacilli  start  to  multiply  and  cause  tissue 
damage (commonly in the lungs) and disease in the affected person. This is called post-primary 
disease (or adult disease), in contrast to primary disease, which is also sometimes referred to 
as  childhood  disease.  Most  TB  patients  develop  their  disease  by  the  post-primary  mechanism 
(approximately 90%).

Clinically TB is divided into two groups, Pulmonary TB and Extra pulmonary TB 

Pulmonary TB is TB that involves the lungs. It is the most common form of TB and accounts 
for approximately 80 percent of all the patients with TB. These patients, particularly the sputum 
smear-positive ones can transmit the bacilli to others. One form of TB of the lungs that deserves 
special mention is endobronchial TB. This form of TB is highly infectious. In this form of TB, 
TB bacilli invade the airways by direct extension from infection in the lung tissue (parenchyma). 
This  kind  of  TB  presents  with  a  barking  cough.  It  may  wheeze  and  easily  misdiagnosed  as 
asthma.  

Extra-pulmonary TB is TB that occurs in organs of the body other than the lungs (including the 
pleura). These patients are unlikely to transmit the bacilli to other people. 

NB:  In  TB  program  setting,  a  TB  patient  with  both  pulmonary  and  extra-pulmonary  TB  is 
classified as a pulmonary TB patient since this category is of public health importance. 

2.2 DIAGNOSIS OF TUBERCULOSIS 

Key points 

  Health care providers should follow the NTLP diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis of TB. 
  Early diagnosis of TB is important for both the individual and the community. 
  Bacteriological  diagnosis  of  TB  depends  on  isolation  of  the  M.tb  organism  or  identification  of 

components e.g. DNA in clinical specimen.  

  All presumptive and diagnosed TB patients should be offered an HIV test. 
  All patients at risk of drug resistance must be screened and investigated for drug resistance. 
  A diagnosis of TB must be recorded in the relevant registers and notified irrespective of whether 

they have started treatment or not. 

2.2.1 Approach to diagnosis of TB 

Diagnosis of TB is based on a compatible TB history including of contact with TB and positive 
TB tests; and where tests are not positive a clinician’s decision to treat as TB. TB irrespective of 
body organ affected presents with constitutional symptoms of fevers (especially in the evening), 
weight loss, and loss of appetite and night sweats. Other symptoms depend of site affected.  

For  pulmonary  TB  (PTB),  the  most  common  form  of  TB,  presents  with  one  or  more  of 
respiratory  of  symptoms  of  cough,  chest  pain,  hemoptysis  and  dyspnea.  Specific  respiratory 
symptoms  of  more  than  two  weeks  are  most  suggestive  of  TB  although  among  those  who  are 
immunosuppressed, such as HIV patients, any of these symptoms for any duration are suggestive 
of TB.   

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  procedure(s)  for  diagnosing  tuberculosis  are  usually  carried  out  on  patients  who  have 
symptoms  and  have  reported  to  the  health  facility  on  their  own.  To  ease  and  standardize  TB 
screening the NTLP has  designed an intensified  TB case  finding form  (ICF), see below.  In all 
care  entry points,  TB screening should be carried out  using the  Intensified Case Finding (ICF) 
guide (Figure 2.2a).  Patients positive on the ICF are termed presumptive TB patients.  

After  the  patient’s  history,  has  been  taken  and  a  physical  exam  has  been  performed, 
investigations are carried out depending on availability of the tests and the TB site. In pulmonary 
TB (PTB) sputum  specimens (1 spot and 1 early morning) are examined using microscopy for 
the TB bacilli or using a new molecular test called Xpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) test.   

If  facilities  are  available,  and  the  patient  is  at  high  risk  of  multidrug  resistance,  the  sputum 
sample  can  also  undergo  MTB  culture  and  drug  susceptibility  test  (DST).  Other  tests  such  as 
chest x-ray (PTB) and histology (lymph nodes, pleural TB, pleural fluid analysis, cerebral spinal 
fluid analysis) are conducted for specific organs affected by TB. 

For  programmatic  purposes,  TB  should  be  diagnosed  following  steps  presented  in  the  national 
algorithm  for  TB  screening,  diagnosis  and  management  (Figure  2.2b).  The  algorithm  has  two 
arms;  one  for  facilities  with  GeneXpert  machine  on  site  and  another  for  facilities  with  no 
machine  on  site.  In  facilities  with  GeneXpert  TB  test  all  presumptive  TB  patients  should  be 
tested on this test. In the same visit, HIV, should be tested.  

In facilities without GeneXpert testing with smear microscopy is recommended. All presumptive 
TB  patients  are  bacteriological  negative  (i.e.  no  laboratory  evidence  of  TB  is  found)  should 
undergo further evaluation (clinical and with chest X-ray, CXR). Patients who have likelihood of 
TB  should  be  treated  as  TB  and  those  who  are  not  need  reassessment.  The  patient’s  clinical 
diagnosis should be treated and reviewed in two weeks’ time.

2.2.2 Laboratory diagnosis 

All efforts should be made to make a laboratory confirmation of TB diagnosis in all patients with 
presumptive  TB.  This  is  important  for  clinical  monitoring  of  treatment  response.  It  is  also 
important for TB reporting and monitoring of TB control efforts. However, a clinician can still 
make a diagnosis of TB even in the absence of confirmatory laboratory confirmation. 

The investigations and tests useful in the diagnosis of TB are described below: 

Bacteriological 

Microscopy 

It  is  the  most  commonly  available  test  currently  for  diagnosis  of  TB.  It  can  be  either  Ziehl-
Neelsen  microscopy  (Figure  2.2.2a)  or  Fluorescence  microscopy  (Figure  2.2.2b).  It  can  be 
used  to  examine  sputum  specimen  or  gastric  aspiration  fluid  or  any  other  body  material 
suspected to contain the TB bacilli. 

Figure 2.2.2a. Positive Ziehl Neelsen Smear                         Figure 2.2.2b.  Positive fluorescent microscopy 

Nuclear Acid Amplification Tests  

Nucleic Acid Amplication tests (NAAT) are based on the principle of detecting and amplifying 
(making more copies of) the M.tb genetic material. In TB diagnosis two tests are now available 
in the clinic namely the Xpert MTB/Rif test and the line probe assay (LPA). 

Xpert MTB/Rif is the most used NAAT in Uganda. Xpert MTB/Rif is an automated DNA test for 
mycobacteria  specific  for  MTB  (IS6110)  and  for  the  mutation  that  causes  resistance  to 
Rifampicin  (rpoB).  The  following  body  fluids  or  samples  can  be  examined  for  TB  using  Xpert 
MTB/Rif: Sputum, Lymph node tissue and aspirates, Pleural fluid, Cerebrospinal fluid and Gastric 
aspirates. Results that can be expected from Xpert MTB/Rif test are shown in the table below.

The probability of finding AFB in sputum specimens by smear microscopy or molecular tests is 
directly  related  to  the  concentration  of  bacilli  in  the  sputum.  In  comparison,  mycobacterial 
culture  can  detect  far  lower  numbers  of  TB  bacilli.  Moreover,  the  culture  makes  it  possible  to 
identify the mycobacterial species based on biochemical and other properties. Culture using both 
solid LJ media and liquid MGIT 960 media. It is done in specialized laboratories for example the 
NTRL. All clinical samples can be cultured. 
Culture  of  M.  tb  bacilli  is  very  sensitive  and  specific,  but  is  expensive,  as  it  is  a  complex  and 
sophisticated procedure. It requires a specialized laboratory set-up, and culture results are available 
only after 6 to 8 weeks. Culture with DST takes even longer. If available, culture can be used for 
diagnosis or confirmation of the diagnosis of TB in patients with PTB and EPTB. Since it is more 
sensitive than smear, culture may also have a role in the diagnosis of smear-negative, HIV-positive 
TB suspects who are likely to be paucibacillary. 

Antigen tests 

TB LAM test is based on the detection of LAM in urine and has the potential to be point-of-care 
tests for TB. WHO recommends the test to assist the diagnosis of TB in HIV positive adult in-
patients  with  signs  and  symptoms  of  TB  (pulmonary  and/or  extra-pulmonary)  with  a  CD4  cell 
count less than or equal to 100 cells/μL, and people living with HIV who are deemed “seriously 
ill”. (http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/laboratory/policy_statement_lam_web.pdf ). 

The NTLP has adopted the use of LAM to assist in the diagnosis of TB in HIV positive adult in-
patients  based on WHO recommendation.  “Seriously ill” is  further defined  based on 4 danger 
signs:  respiratory  rate >  30/min,  temperature > 39°C, heart  rate > 120/min and unable to  walk 
unaided 

2.2.3 Radiology  

Radiology  investigations  such  as  chest  X-ray:    Features  of  chest  X-ray  consistent  with  TB 
disease  include  cavitation  (Figure  2.3a)  milliary  picture  (Figure  2.3b),  pleural  effusion  and 
mediastinal lymph gland enlargement with lung infiltration. Although the findings of radiology 
are nonspecific, abnormalities like any heterogeneous opacities and cavitation, if located in the 
upper parts of the lung, are more likely to be caused by TB.

All  presumptive  TB  patients  who  are  bacteriologically  negative  should  be  offered  CXR  and  if 
suggestive of TB, treatment should be initiated (Refer to NTLP TB diagnostic algorithm above)

Ultrasound 

Diagnostic  ultrasound  is  a  useful  test  in  the  diagnosis  of  extra  pulmonary  TB.  For  example, 
ultrasound is useful in abdominal TB in which case you can see omental thickening, increase in 
mesenteric  thickness  and  an  increase  in  the  mesenteric  echogenicity  (due  to  fat  deposition), 
combined with retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        14 

 
 
 
   
 
 
Presence of dilated and matted small bowel loops and ascites further substantiate the diagnosis. 
Calcifications  within  granulomas  due  to  TB  in  the  liver  and  spleen  can  also  be  picked  by 
abdominal ultrasound scans. 

2.2.4 Histology 

Pathology  can  play  a  complementary  role  in  confirming  the  diagnosis  of  EPTB,  such  as 
tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Multiplication of tubercle bacilli in any site of the human body causes 
a specific type of inflammation, with formation of characteristic granuloma that can be found on 
histological examination.  

Samples can be taken in the following ways: 

  Fine  needle  aspiration  of  the  lymph  nodes:  affected  peripheral  lymph  nodes, 

particularly cervical nodes, can be aspirated.  

  Tissue biopsy: serous membranes (pleura, pericardium and peritoneum), skin, lymph 
node,  endometrium,  bronchial  mucosa  or  liver  tissue  can  be  taken,  with  an 
appropriate instrument or during surgery. Surgical procedures can be useful in getting 
tissues for biopsy from deep organs.  

2.2.3 Case Definitions 

For standardizing the process of data collection (case registration) and TB reporting requirements 
to permit for cohort analysis of treatment outcomes, case definitions are necessary. Standard TB 
case definitions are shown in table 2.1 

Note: 

For a presumptive TB patient to be treated as a TB patient, s/he must first be declared a TB 
patient and decision is made to treat him/her for TB. A TB patient is what is referred to as a case 
of TB. However not all TB patients have the same classification. It is this process of classifying 
the different types of TB patients that is called Case definition.

Table 2.2.2: Standard TB case definitions 

Case definition  

Description  

Presumptive  TB 
patient 

Any  patient  who  presents  with  symptoms  and  signs  suggestive  of  TB 
(previously called a TB suspect). 

Bacteriologically 
confirmed 
TB 
patient 

A bacteriologically confirmed TB patient is one from whom a biological 
specimen  is  positive  by  smear  microscopy,  culture,  Nucleic  Acid 
Amplification  Tests  e.g.  Xpert  MTB/RIF  or  WHO  recommend  new 
diagnostics. All such cases should be recorded in the unit TB register and 
notified, regardless of whether TB treatment has been started. 

Clinically 
diagnosed 
patient 

TB 

A clinically  diagnosed TB  patient is  one who  does not  fulfil the  criteria 
for bacteriological confirmation but has been diagnosed with active TB by 
a clinician or other medical practitioner who has decided to give the patient 
a full course of TB treatment. This definition includes cases diagnosed on 
the  basis  of  X-ray  abnormalities  or  suggestive  histology  and  extra-
pulmonary  cases  without  laboratory  confirmation.  Clinically  diagnosed 
cases  subsequently  found  to  be  bacteriologically  positive  (before  or  after 
starting treatment) should be reclassified as bacteriologically confirmed. 

2.2.3 Classification of TB patients? 

Four  factors  determine  the  classification:  the  site  of  the  disease  (body  organ  involved),  drug 
resistance, HIV status and the patient’s history of previous treatment. 

Classification based on Site of the disease 

The description below applies to all patients irrespective of HIV status.  

A.  Pulmonary  tuberculosis  (PTB);  Refers  to  any  bacteriologically  confirmed  or  clinically 
diagnosed  case  of  TB  involving  the  lung  parenchyma  or  the  tracheobronchial  tree. 
Tuberculous  intra-thoracic  lymphadenopathy  (mediastinal  and/or  hilar)  or  tuberculous 
pleural  effusion,  without  radiographic  abnormalities  in  the  lungs,  constitutes  a  case  of 
extra-pulmonary TB.  

B.  Extra-pulmonary  tuberculosis  (EPTB);  Refers  to  any  bacteriologically  confirmed  or 
clinically diagnosed case of TB involving organs other than the lungs, e.g. pleura, lymph 
nodes, abdomen, genitourinary tract, skin, joints bones, and meninges. 

A patient with both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB should be classified as a case of 
PTB. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        16 

 
 
 
Classification based on History of treatment 

There are two types of TB patients based on treatment history 

1) New patients: These are patients who have never been treated for TB or have taken anti-TB 
drugs for less than one month. 

2) Previously treated TB patients: These are patients who have received one month or more of 
anti TB drugs in the past. They are sub classified as follows:  

i)  Relapse  patients  have  previously  been  treated  for  TB,  completed  treatment,  were  declared 
cured  or  treatment  completed  at  the  end  of  their  most  recent  course  of  treatment,  and  are  now 
diagnosed with a recurrent episode of TB (either a true relapse or a new episode of TB caused by 
reinfection); 

ii)  Treatment  after  failure  patients:  are  those  who  have  previously  been  treated  for  TB  and 
whose treatment failed at the end of their most recent course of treatment; 

iii) Treatment after loss to follow-up patients: have previously been treated for TB and were 
declared  lost  to  follow-up  at  the  end  of  their  most  recent  course  of  treatment.  (These  were 
previously known as treatment after default patients). 

iv) Other previously  treated patients  are those who have previously  been treated  for TB but 
whose Outcome after their most recent course of treatment is unknown or undocumented. 

3) Patients with unknown previous TB treatment history do not fit into any of the categories 
listed above.  

NB: New and relapse cases of TB are incident TB cases.  

Classification based on HIV infection status 

HIV-positive TB patient refers to any bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case 
of TB who has a positive result from HIV testing conducted at the time of TB diagnosis or other 
documented  evidence  of  enrolment  in  HIV  care,  such  as  enrolment  in  the  pre-antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) register or in the ART register once ART has been started.  

HIV-negative TB patient refers to any bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case 
of TB who has a negative result from HIV testing conducted at the time of TB diagnosis. Any 
HIV-negative  TB  patient  subsequently  found  to  be  HIV-positive  should  be  reclassified 
accordingly.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV  status  unknown  TB  patient  refers  to  any  bacteriologically  confirmed  or  clinically 
diagnosed  case  of  TB  who  has  no  result  of  HIV  testing  and  no  other  documented  evidence  of 
enrolment in HIV care. If the patient’s HIV status is subsequently determined, he or she should 
be reclassified accordingly. 

Classification based on Drug resistance 
Cases are classified in categories based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) of clinical isolates 
confirmed to be M. tb: 

Mono resistance: resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only. 

Poly  drug  resistance:  resistance  to  more  than  one  first-line  anti-TB  drug  (other  than  both 
Isoniazid and Rifampicin). 

Multidrug resistance: resistance to at least both Isoniazid and Rifampicin. 

Extensive drug resistance: resistance to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of three second-
line  injectable  drugs  (Capreomycin,  Kanamycin  and  Amikacin),  in  addition  to  multidrug 
resistance. 

Rifampicin  resistance:  Resistance  to  Rifampicin  detected  using  phenotypic  (usual  drug 
susceptibility testing, DST) or genotypic methods (commonly Xpert MTB/Rif), with or without 
resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any resistance to Rifampicin, whether mono, poly, 
multi,  or  extensively  drug  resistance.  These  categories  are  not  all  mutually  exclusive.  When 
enumerating  Rifampicin  resistant  TB  (RR-TB),  for  instance,  multi-drug  TB  (MDR-TB),  and 
Extensively drug resistance (XDR-TB) are also included.  
“Pre-XDR” TB:  refers to an isolate that is resistant to either a fluoroquinolone or a second-line 
injectable,  but  not  both.  It  is  a  commonly  used  designation  but  not  officially  accepted 
terminology by WHO or the global TB community. 

2.2.4 Post TB patients  

Currently  there  is  no  consensus  definition  of  a  post  TB  patient.  However  these  patients 
commonly present to TB clinicians. A post TB patient is a patient who was successfully treated 
for TB who presents with respiratory symptoms. Many people who have been treated and cured 
of TB continue to present with respiratory symptoms long after their TB is cured. The common 
symptoms are chest pain, cough, shortness of breath and hemoptysis.   

The  public  health  importance  of  these  patients  is  just  being  recognized.  There  are  no  standard 
guidelines on how they can be evaluated and treated. Health workers should immediately repeat

a  TB  evaluation  according  standard  TB  diagnosis  practices  (sputum  examination  and  chest  x-
rays). If the sputum is positive for TB, the patient is then treated as retreatment TB as described 
elsewhere in this manual. If TB tests are negative the patients should be further re-evaluated for 
post  TB  lung  diseases  namely  bronchiectasis,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
pulmonary hypertension, and colonization with fungal infections such as aspergillosis. 

In most cases these patients will have residual lung damage on chest x-rays from the previous TB 
episode.  This  usually  prompts  the  health  worker  to  retreat  as  bacteriologically  negative  TB. 
Indeed, many patients have been treated this way several times exposing them to repeated toxic 
effects of TB treatment.

2.3 TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS 

  Early diagnosis and effective treatment of TB are critical to improving clinical outcomes of TB patients. 
  Anti-TB drugs are given in combinations called regimens according to patients’ TB category. 
  Different  standardized  TB  treatment  regimens  are  recommended  for  pan  susceptible  and  drug  resistant 

TB. 

  Anti-TB drugs have side effects of varied severity and these should be managed appropriately. 
  TB  treatment  monitoring  should  be  done  by  clinical,  sputum  and  where  possible  by  radiological 

examination. 

  A conclusion of treatment outcome status should be done for every patient treated for TB.  

Early  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  is  the  key  to  stop  the  spread  of  TB  and  to  improve 
treatment outcomes of patients suffering from TB. Individuals should start treatment as soon as 
possible after a diagnosis of TB is made and should be treated according to NTLP recommended 
regimens under Directly Observed Treatment (DOT). 
The aims of treatment are to: 

  Cure the TB patient 
  Prevent complications and death from TB disease 
  Prevent TB relapse 
  Reduce TB transmission 
  Prevent development of drug-resistant TB  

2.3.1 Anti-TB medicines  

Anti-TB medicines can be classified into first and second line.  
First-line  anti-TB  medicines  are  used  for  the  treatment  of  susceptible  TB  while  second  line 
medicines are used for treatment of drug resistant TB. 

The first-line anti-TB medicines, together with their standard abbreviations, are shown below: 

Rifampicin (R) 
Isoniazid (H) 
Pyrazinamide (Z) 
Ethambutol (E) 

This section considers details the first-line anti-TB medicines.

*Dose adjustment may be required in special situations 

Fixed-dose combinations  

In the table above, anti-TB drugs are presented as single drugs. However, these drugs are usually 
given as fixed-dose combinations (FDC). The FDCs contain two or more drugs in a single tablet 
with  known  strength  (mg)  of  the  drugs  in  each  tablet.  Examples  of  FDC  TB  drugs  used  in  the 
country include; 2-drug FDC [Rifampicin+ Isoniazid (RH)], 3-drug FDC [Rifampicin+ Isoniazid+ 
Pyrazinamide  (RHZ)]  and  4-drug  FDC  [Rifampicin+  Isoniazid+  Pyrazinamide+  Ethambutol 
(RHZE)].  

FDC tablets have the following advantages: 

  Prescription  errors  are  minimized.  Dosage  recommendations  are  more  accurate  and 

adjustment of the dose according to patient weight is easier. 

  The patient has fewer tablets to swallow, which contributes to adherence. 
 

If the treatment is not supervised, patients cannot be selective about which  the drugs to 
swallow.

2.3.2 TB Treatment Regimens 

Anti-TB  drugs  are  given  in  combinations  called  regimens.  The  regimens  have  the  following 
characteristics; 

  Contain at least one of the most effective anti-TB drugs (Rifampicin or Isoniazid) in both 

the initial and continuation phase of treatment 

  Must  be  written  in  abbreviation  that  clearly  identifies  the  drugs  in  the  initial  and 

continuation phases of treatment 

  Defines a specific duration of treatment and frequency of giving the drugs 
  Duration in months is written in numbers in prefix for which the drugs that follow should 

be taken.  

  The slash (/) separates initial from continuation phase. For examples, 2RHZE/4RH means 
an  initial  phase  of  two  months  consisting  of  daily  Rifampicin,  Isoniazid,  Pyrazinamide 
and Ethambutol, followed by a 4-month continuation phase of Rifampicin and Isoniazid.  

There are also second-line anti-TB drugs used for treating drug-resistant TB (Section 2.6.5).

New patients; are TB patients with no prior history of TB treatment or had been treated for less 
than one month. On the other hand, previously treated patients are those with prior history of TB 
treatment.  

Previously  treated  patients;  are  of  different  types:  relapses,  treatment  failures  and  loss  to 
follow up. The later needs close follow to address the issues surrounding loss follow up. The risk 
of drug resistance is also higher in this group and should therefore get  an Xpert MTB/Rif test. 
Previously treated TB patients were treated with a category 2 treatment regimen. This category 
included  drugs  used  in  first  line  regimen  but  streptomycin  would  be  added  onto  the  regimen. 
Streptomycin was added mainly to address drug resistance.  

Currently with the availability of rapid methods to identify key drug resistance such as the Xpert 
MTB/Rif  test  all  patients  presenting  with  a  previous  history  of  TB  treatment  are  tested  with 
Xpert  MTB/Rif  and  if  they  do  not  have  rifampicin  resistance  they  are  treated  with  first  line 
regimen.  

This development has therefore necessitated a new categorization of TB patients: Drug sensitive 
TB  (DS  TB)  and  multidrug  resistant  TB  (RR/MDR  TB).  DS  TB  patients  are  treated  with  first 
line TB drugs while RR/MDR TB patients are treated with second line TB drugs.  

2.3.4 Recommended Standard Regimens in Uganda 

I. Susceptible TB  
Initial phase: The initial phase is the first two months of treatment. The combination of 4 drugs 
used  during  this  phase  is  Isoniazid,  Rifampicin,  Pyrazinamide  and  Ethambutol  (RHZE).  Using 
these 4 drugs, results in rapid killing of the tubercle bacilli.  Patients become non-infectious in 
about 2 weeks. Symptoms reduce, and most smear-positive cases become smear-negative within 
the first 2 months. 

Continuation  phase:  The  continuation  phase  is  the  second  part  of  treatment  which  lasts  4 
months. Here, two drugs are used in combination, usually Rifampicin and Isoniazid (RH).

II. Rifampicin resistant TB 

These  patients  should  be  treated  with  second  line  regimen  which  is  used  for  treatment  of 
RR/MDR-TB  according  to  national  RR/MDR-TB  treatment  guidelines.  Current  regimens  are 
described in the chapter for RR/MDR-TB. 

 2.3.5 Adjunctive therapy during TB treatment 

Non-anti-TB  drugs  are  usually  given  to  accompany  anti-TB  treatment.  There  are  two  such 
commonly used drugs, namely pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) and prednisolone. 

I. 

Pyridoxine:  This  drug  may  be  given  to  all  TB  patients  once  they  start  on  treatment. 
Isoniazid  interferes  with  the  metabolism  of  pyridoxine  in  the  body  thus  leading  to  its 
deficiency and hence peripheral neuropathy.  Pyridoxine should thus be given in a dose of 
25 mg daily for the entire duration the patient is on Isoniazid containing regimen. In case 
of  peripheral  neuropathy,  a  high  dose  (up  to  max  dose  of  200mg)  should  be  given  until 
symptoms resolve followed by maintenance (25mg) dose up to end of TB therapy 

II.  Prednisolone:  This  is  a  high  potency  anti-inflammatory  drug,  and  is  therefore  useful  in 
TB  patients  in  whom  complications  of  severe  fibrosis  are  anticipated  because  of  severe 
inflammation  such  as  TB  meningitis.  Prednisolone  is  given  in  a  dose  of  1-2mg/kg  body 
weight  (not  more  than  60mg/day)  as  a  single  dose  for  four  weeks,  and  then  tapered  off 
over two weeks.

Box 2.1 Key messages for TB patients 

The health worker should provide this information to the TB patients started on treatment 
to facilitate adherence. 

Key Messages for TB Patients 

1. TB is a disease caused by a germ (bacteria) that is very strong and difficult to kill by just one drug. 

Because of this: 

2. The treatment uses a combination of more than one drug, and takes a long time (6 months). The treatment is 
divided into two parts. In the first part, lasting 2 months you will take more drugs than in the second part 
which lasts 4 months. 

During the 6 months of your treatment: 

3. You will be requested to give sputum for examination at 2 months, 5 months and in the 6th month. This is a 

continuous check to see how the drugs are working on the germs that caused your disease. 

4. Do not stop taking the drugs even if you feel well because TB will not be cured if you stop the drugs before 

the correct time has passed. You have to be discharged from treatment when you are confirmed cured. 

Should you feel the drugs are giving you problems 

5. Do not stop taking the drugs by yourself or on someone else’s advice. Report your problem  immediately to 

the health worker at the facility where you collect your drugs; you will be helped properly. 

Remember 
This should be preceded by explanation about how TB spreads and risk to family etc 
6. To bring your family members, particularly children under 5 years of age to be checked for TB; particularly if 

they are suffering from cough. 

7.  If  you  came  from  a  village  for  treatment  in  town and  would  like  to  go  back,  (or  you  wish  to  change  your 
residence) before 6 months of treatment are completed, tell the health worker who gives you your drugs, who 
will explain how to get drugs from your changed place of residence. 

8. When you cough, turn your face away from people. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or hands. 
9. As a TB patient, it is important for you to know your HIV status. You are hereby advised take an HIV test.

2.3.6 Treatment monitoring 

Once a TB patient is started on treatment, it is important to find out if the patient is getting better 
as  a  result  of  the  treatment.  This  is  called  treatment  monitoring.  The  following  methods  are 
used for treatment monitoring in order of importance: 

Laboratory  monitoring–  Sputum  microscopy  (or  culture)  must  be  used  for  monitoring  all 
pulmonary TB patients. Sputum smears are performed at the end of the initial phase (2 months), 
at beginning of 5 months and beginning of 6th month of treatment. This should be done for both 
smear-positive and smear-negative pulmonary TB patients. 

If  the  patient  has  a  sputum  smear  that  is  positive  at  the  end  of  the  initial  phase  of  treatment, 
consider the following as possible explanations: 
  The treatment was poorly supervised. 
  The bacillary load was too high, e.g. in cavitary disease with slow clearance of the bacilli. 
  The patient could have RR/MDR-TB. 
  Could also be dead bacteria 

For  patients  registered  as  sputum  smear-negative  before  the  anti-TB  treatment  was  started, 
clinical  monitoring  is  recommended  together  with  sputum  monitoring.  Sputum  examination  is 
important in these patients because: 

  An error could have occurred at the time of diagnosis 
  The patient may have drug-resistant TB 

Box 2.2 shows the action points to be taken during sputum smear monitoring in a new case. 
For patients on second line drugs, treatment should be done as for MDR TB patients.  GeneXpert 
should  not  be  used  for  treatment  monitoring.  However,  it  can  be  used  to  exclude  rifampicin 
resistance in patients who have positive sputum smears during treatment

Box 2.2. Monitoring treatment for susceptible TB cases 

Action points during treatment 
At the end of the initial 2 months: 

  Sputum smear-negative; start continuation phase 
  Sputum smear-positive; do Xpert MTB/Rif, If RR, refer for MDR treatment and if RS, continue 
with first-line treatment, explore adherence issues but repeat smear at 3 months, if positive, do 
DST, if smear negative continues with first-line treatment.  

At the end of 5 months: 

  Sputum smear-negative, continue with continuation treatment 
  Sputum smear-positive, diagnose Treatment Failure 
  Take sputum for GeneXpert to rule out RR. 
 
 

If RR, refer for DR treatment. 
If MTB detected but not RR and re start first line regimen but explore adherence issues 

At the end of 6thmonths: 

  Sputum smear-negative, complete treatment and declare cured or treatment completed 
  Sputum smear-positive, diagnose treatment failure 
  Take sputum for GeneXpert to rule out RR. 

 
 

If RR, refer for DR treatment. 
If MTB detected but not R restart first line regimen but explore adherence issues 

Clinical monitoring  –is  useful  for  all  patients  but  is  particularly  useful  for  children  and  extra-
pulmonary  TB  cases.  Treatment  monitoring  is  carried  out  through  clinical  observation.  A 
patient’s weight gain and reduction in symptoms are useful indicators. 

Radiological monitoring –is a method that should not be used as the sole monitoring tool.  

In  cases  where  radiological  monitoring  is  used,  sputum  and  clinical  monitoring  should 
accompany the radiological monitoring. 

2.3.7 Monitoring and recording adverse effects 

Most  TB  patients  complete  their  treatment  without  any  significant  adverse  drug  effects. 
However, a few patients do experience adverse effects. It is therefore important that patients are 
clinically monitored during treatment so that adverse effects are promptly detected and properly 
managed. Routine laboratory monitoring is not necessary. Health personnel can monitor adverse 
drug  effects  by  teaching  patients  how  to  recognize  the  symptoms  of  common  effects,  urging 
them  to  report  if  they  develop  such  symptoms,  and  by  asking  about  symptoms  when  patients 
come to collect drugs.  
Adverse reactions to drugs should be recorded on the TB Treatment Card under “comments” and 
treatment register under the remarks section

2.3.8 Defining Treatment Outcome 

A conclusion should be  made regarding  treatment  outcome of every TB patient  who has been 
started  on  anti-TB  treatment  within  the  same  year  (reporting  period).  This  is  called  Cohort 
Analysis.      In  considering  treatment  outcomes,  a  distinction  is  made  between  two  types  of 
patients: 

  Patients treated for drug-susceptible TB; 
  Patients treated for drug-resistant TB using second-line treatment  

The two groups are mutually exclusive. Any patient found to have drug-resistant TB and placed 
on second line treatment is removed from the drug-susceptible TB outcome cohort. This means 
that management of the standard TB register and of the second-line TB treatment register needs 
to be coordinated to ensure proper accounting of the outcomes of treatment. 

Box 2.3 presents Treatment outcomes for TB patients (excluding patients treated for RR-TB or 
MDR-TB), treated outcomes for RR-TB and MDR TB are given in the section for MDR TB. 

Box 2.3 Treatment outcomes for TB patients (excluding patients treated for RR-TB or MDR-TB) 

Treatment outcome definitions 

a)  Cure: A pulmonary TB patient with bacteriologically confirmed TB at the beginning 
of treatment who was smear- or culture-negative in the last month of treatment and on 
at least one previous occasion 

b)  Treatment completed: A TB patient who completed treatment without evidence of 
failure BUT with no record to show that sputum smear or culture results in the last 
month of treatment and on at least one previous occasion were negative, either 
because tests were not done or because results are unavailable  

c)  Treatment failed: A TB patient whose sputum smear or culture is positive at month 5 
or later during treatment. Or was negative at beginning and is smear positive at 2 
months 

d)  Died: A TB patient who dies for any reason before starting or during the course of 

treatment. 

e)  Lost to follow-up A TB patient who did not start treatment or who completed more 
than 1 month of treatment and was interrupted for 2 consecutive months or more. 
f)  Not Evaluated: A patient for whom no treatment outcome is assigned. This includes 

cases “transferred out” to another treatment unit as well as cases for whom the 
treatment outcome is unknown to the reporting unit.  

g)  Treatment success: The sum of cured and treatment completed.

2.3.9 Treatment adherence  

TB  patients  must  take  all  their  medications  in  order  to  ensure  that  cure  is  achieved.  However, 
some  TB  patients  do  not  take  all  their  medications.  One  of  the  key  strategy  to  treatment 
adherence  is  directly  observed  therapy  (DOT).  Patients  are  observed  while  taking  their 
medications.  There  two  forms  of  DOT:  Facility  DOT  and  community  DOT).  In  facility  based 
DOT,  TB  treatment  is  observed  by  a  health  worker  at  the  health  facility.  Community  DOT 
involves observation of the patient taking medication in the community by a trained community 
health worker (VHT, CHEWs, expert client etc.) or a family member who serves as a treatment 
supporter.  This  person  can  be  a  community  volunteer  or  a  relative  of  the  patient.  Treatment 
should be patient centered. NTLP will develop a standard strategy for community based TB care 
to guide implementation of DOT.  

2.3.9.1 Implementation of CB-DOTS in a Rural Setting  

Community-based  DOT  implementation  is  usually  linked  to  a  health  facility,  which  is  usually 
located in a sub-county. Each sub county has a person responsible for DOT for all TB patients in 
that sub county. Until now this person is called a sub county health workers (SCHW) within the 
NTLP  system.  The  SCHW  is  a  key  person  in  the  implementation  of  community-based  DOT. 
SCHWs  have  worked  closely  with  village  health  teams  in  the  delivery  of  CB-DOTS.  The 
government  of  Uganda  is  planning  a  new  cadre  of  community  health  workers  called  the 
community  health  extension  worker.  When  this  cadre  of  health  worker  becomes  active,  it  is 
hoped that they play a key role in the implementation of CB-DOTS. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        30 

 
 
 
 
 
TB patients who are diagnosed in the health facilities and do not require hospitalization and who 
opt  for,  should  be  enrolled  in  community-based  DOT.  The  SCHW  is  informed  by  the  health 
facility staff about the patient and contacts the VHT or Local Council (LC) I who will convene a 
community meeting to identify a treatment supporter to supervise the patient’s  TB treatment in 
the  community.  The  SCHW  will  brief,  orient  and  supervise  the  treatment  supporters.    After 
training is completed, the SCHW provides the treatment supporter with a two-week supply of the 
anti-TB drugs and a patient treatment card for each patient with TB in the community.  

The  treatment  supporter  is  responsible  for  ensuring  DOT  and  recording  each  dose  of  anti-TB 
drugs swallowed on the patient treatment card. The treatment supporter will also be responsible 
for referring the TB patient to the health facility at end of 2 (3), 5 and  6 months for follow-up 
sputum checks and to monitor the patient for side-effects. If the treatment supporter identifies TB 
suspects  (i.e.  with  a  cough  of  two  weeks  or  more  duration)  in  the  community,  the  treatment 
supporter should refer them to the health facility for evaluation. 

The  SCHW  will  visit  the  treatment  supporter  every  two  weeks  during  the  intensive  phase  and 
monthly during the continuation phase to replenish drug supplies, review and record information 
from  the  patient  treatment  card  and  provide  additional  training  as  needed.  The  SCHW  liaises 
with both the VHT and LC I to update records and recommend community action.  
Procedures to observe for TB patients who opt for a family member as a treatment supporter: 
  Upon diagnosis  of TB, the health worker must observe the swallowing of the  first  dose, 
give a one-week supply of drugs and request the patient to bring the proposed treatment 
supporter within 1 week, before the drugs are finished. 
If the TB patient has someone who can be a treatment supporter, the health worker then 
trains this person to carry out the responsibilities of a treatment supporter.  

 

  The health worker should link the treatment supporter to the SCHW. 

Note:  

TB patients who are too ill to be started on community-based DOT should be admitted or 

referred to a health facility with admission facilities. The health facility nurse will be 

responsible for observing the swallowing of drugs and recording the information on the 

patient treatment card. TB patients who are no longer ill enough to require hospitalization will 

be referred to the nearest health facility and started on community-based DOT.

2.3.9.2 Implementation of CB-DOTS in an Urban Setting 

The management of TB patients in large hospitals and health centers located in urban areas poses 
special  challenges.  The  advantage  of  shorter  distances  from  the  health  facilities  is  unfortunately 
counteracted by many factors; i) the de facto lack of coordination between private and public sector 
and ii) the frequent  absence of an  extended family who can support the  patients  and their closest 
relatives during the time of sickness.  

Further, the majority of patients stop the treatment which poses extremely serious immediate threats 
to  the  health  of  the  patients  and  their  families  and  increases  the  transmission  of  TB  in  an 
environment that is obviously more populated than the rural areas. Despite all these constraints, the 
anti-TB treatment must still be observed, completed and evaluated for the sake of curing the patient 
and controlling TB. As the social structure and the organization of the health services in large cities 
are  different  from  that  of  rural  areas,  the  implementation  of  DOT  must  follow  different  steps 
outlined below.  

After the diagnosis of tuberculosis is established: 

 

 

If the patient’s clinical  condition  requires  admission  to  a health facility, the nurses start  DOT 
and  are  responsible  for  the  daily  administration  of  drugs  and  the  daily  update  of  the  patient 
treatment card. 
If  the  patient’s  clinical  condition  allows  for  immediate  referral  home,  the  patient  is  given  the 
essential information about the disease and its treatment, given the first dose of anti-TB drugs to 
swallow  and  is  told  to  return  along  with  a  treatment  supporter  to  attend  a  session  of  health 
education and training on how to administer DOT at home.  

  Patients may receive enough drugs for a few days if they cannot return the following day. They 

should be told that the drugs are available free of charge.  

  On  returning  with  the  treatment  supporter  for  the  health  education  session  (ideally  organized 
twice  a  week  at  the  health  facility),  the  patient  will  receive  a  2-week  drug  supply  during  the 
intensive phase and a 4-week drug supply during the continuation phase. 

  Every two weeks during the intensive phase, or every four weeks during the continuation phase, 
either  the  patient  or  the  treatment  supporter  will  return  to  the  health  facility  to  receive  a  new 
drug  supply,  to  report  any  problem/complication  of  treatment  and  to  allow  transposition  of 
information from the patient treatment card to the Unit TB Register. All TB patients admitted 
for initial treatment will continue DOT at home with the support of a treatment supporter, after 
their discharge from the hospital. 

Note: 
An essential component of the CB-DOTS model is the referral system between Diagnostic Unit 
 Sub-county Health Worker  community at LC1, VHT and  the treatment supporter living 
close to the patient. This referral system cannot be reproduced in urban areas because of their 
different social organization and because the primary healthcare (PHC) system is weaker.

In view of the challenges with DOT in urban areas several innovations are being tried in Uganda to 
find  ways  to  overcome  the  challenges  of  DOT  in  urban  settings.  One  such  innovation,  called 
URBAN DOTS model (Figure 2.5), is being implemented in Kampala city. The model consists of 
the following strategies;  

(1)  Strengthening  the  leadership  and  coordination  of  TB  services  in  Kampala  Capital  City 
Authority through establishing the urban TB control task force. 
(2) Increasing access to TB diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up services by increasing the number 
of DTUs. 
(3) Engaging community linkage facilitators (CLFs) to follow-up patients at the community level. 
(4)  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  existing  TB  diagnostic  and  treatment  facilities  in  KCCA  to 
provide improved TB services.  
(5)  Supporting  the  integration  of  TB  and  HIV  services  at  health  facility  level  through 
implementation of appropriate TB/HIV integration models and continuous quality improvement. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        33 

 
 
 
In a two-year period of implementing the URBAN DOTS model, the proportion of TB patients on 
DOT increased significantly from 7% to 89%, and cure rate among the pulmonary bacteriologically 
confirmed TB patients increased from 43% to 75%. HIV testing among TB patients increased from 
78% to 99% while ART and CPT coverage among the TB HIV co infected patients increased from 
92% to 98% and 56% to 95% respectively.  

The  key  component  of  the  URBAN  DOTS  model  is  the  deployment  of  Community  Linkage 
Facilitators (CLFs). Each health facility providing TB services should explore ways of identifying a 
CLFs. CLFs can be volunteers or health workers already working on community health. 

2.3.9.3 Engaging Private Providers in CB-DOTS Implementation 
Private  providers  play  a  big  role  in  diagnosing  and  treating  TB.  Efforts  have  been  made  by  the 
NTLP  to  engage  some  of  the  private  providers  to  ensure  appropriate  delivery  of  TB  services 
through a coordinated framework. The different categories of private providers who can play a role 
in managing presumptive and diagnosed TB patients include: 

  Private health providers 
  Private, not-for-profit hospitals and health centers 
 
  Pharmacies and drug shops 
  Practitioners of traditional medical systems 

Individual private physicians, nurses, midwives, clinical officers, etc. 

The  NTLP  can  engage  the  private  providers  in  several  ways  depending  on  the  capacity  and 
operational  level  of  the  private  provider.  The  public-private  mix  (PPM)  DOTS  strategy  shall 
include but not be limited to:   

  NTLP Training health workers in large hospitals and clinics, on the identification of patients 
with  presumptive  TB  patients  and  diagnosis  of  TB.  The  health  workers  in  these  large 
hospitals  and  clinics  should  also  be  trained  to  carry  out  recording  and  reporting  using  the 
NTLP monitoring and evaluation tools. Quarterly reports from such private health providers 
are submitted to DTLS to be forwarded to RTLFP.  

  The  support  provided  to  private  providers  by  NTLP  &  the  District  Health  Office:    NTLP 

and DHOs’ offices do: 

  Conduct training for health workers of the smaller private provider units so that they 
can  recognize  and  refer  patients  with  presumptive  TB  to  diagnostic  facilities  and 
keep a record of such referrals  

  Conduct  regular  training  to  update  private  providers  on  current  TB  management 

recommendations  

  Provide private provider facilities with support supervisory visits to ensure that the 

private providers carry out their work according to NTLP recommendations. 

  Provide anti-TB drugs to private health providers  
  Monitor private providers to ensure they do not charge TB patients for the anti-TB 

drugs provided.

2.3.9.4 Facility based DOT 

Patients  have their anti-TB treatment  observed daily by the health worker at  the health facility  at 
least  during  the  intensive  phase  of  treatment.  Patient  that  live  near  the  health  facility  or  those 
admitted should benefit from facility DOT. 

2.4 PREVENTIVE TUBERCULOSIS THERAPY 

  To  prevent  the  progression  of  LTBI  to  active  TB,  IPT  is  recommended  for  all  HIV  positive

persons irrespective of TST results and CD4 cell count. 
IPT is also recommended for under five-year child contacts of persons with active infectious TB.  

 
  Exclusion of active TB using symptom screening algorithms is highly recommended. 
  Pregnancy  should  not  be  used  to  exclude  women  living  with  HIV/AIDS  from  symptom  based 
screening  and  receiving  IPT.  More  still,  IPT  therapy  should  be  completed  even  if  the  woman 
becomes pregnant while still on IPT treatment. 
IPT treatment monitoring to foster treatment adherence is key in ensuring successful treatment. 
outcomes 

 

TB infection occurs  when a susceptible person is exposed to  an infectious source  case  (usually  a 
pulmonary TB patient). In 90-95% of cases, the infected person's immune system halts growth of 
the  bacteria  and  active  disease  does  not  develop,  although  skin  or  serological  testing  for  TB  will 
convert to positive. Once positive, a person's TB test will generally remain positive for life. It is this 
state of positive skin or serological tests that is called latent TB infection (LTBI). 

Currently one in three people worldwide are infected with tuberculosis bacilli. It is estimated that 
up to 90% of the TB that is active develops in people with latent TB as a reactivation.  

Preventive  therapy  of  TB  is  the  use  of  anti-TB  drug(s)  to  prevent  the  development  of  active  TB 
disease in an individual who has latent TB infection (LTBI). 

For  this  reason,  LTBI  therapy  t  is  a  key  component  of  TB  control.  Probably  TB  elimination  will 
occur once there is wide use of LTBI treatment.  

LTBI therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of developing active TB by over 60% in several 
studies. The efficacy varies according to regimen and duration. For  example, the use of  Isoniazid 
(H) for up to 12 months has a protective efficacy of up to 83%.  

There  have  been  variable  delays  in  wider  use  of  LTBI  therapy  for  several  reasons.  Firstly,  the 
protection is short lived (up to 3 years). Re-infection is high and there was fear of development of 
resistance to the drugs used if active TB is not excluded. Toxicity to the used drug is also a concern. 
In consideration of these concerns preventive therapy is recommended for groups of patients who 
are most likely to benefit most. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uganda  NTLP  National  preventive  guidelines  recommend  preventive  therapy  using  a  six  -month 
regimen  of  only  Isoniazid  as  monotherapy  (Isoniazid  preventive  therapy,  IPT)  for  under  5-year 
contacts of infectious pan susceptible TB who do not have active TB.  It must be noted that other 
drugs can be used either in combination with Isoniazid or alone. Such drugs include Rifampicin or 
rifapentine.  

Diagnosis  of  latent  TB:  LTBI  is  confirmed  by  a  positive  tuberculin  skin  test  (TST).  The 
commonest method for the TST is the Mantoux method. For this reason, the TST is loosely called 
the Mantoux test in clinical settings. 

TST is  positive when the induration of TST has a diameter of 5 or more mm in  an HIV-positive 
person  and  10  or  more  mm  in  an  HIV-  negative  person.  Other  blood  tests  for  LTBI  namely 
Quantiferon TB Gold and TB SPOT  have been developed. These tests are generally less accurate 
and more expensive than the TST but they have some advantages over TST. They do not require a 
second visit to read the test as is the case with TST, they do not react in non-MTB infections.  

2.4.2 Target populations for TB preventive therapy 

The highest risk for reactivation of LTBI to active TB disease occurs in the populations below and 
they are therefore the key target populations for TB preventive therapy 

  Persons living with HIV/AIDS 
  Child contacts of pulmonary TB patients 
  Persons with immunosuppression e.g. Diabetics 
  Persons  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  congregate  settings  e.g.  Prisoners,  Health  workers  and 

internally displaced persons 

2.4.3 Principles of preventive TB therapy initiation 

The following principles guide preventive TB treatment 

1.  Latent TB infection must be diagnosed.  Several studies have shown that the greatest benefit 
from TB preventive therapy occurs in those with a confirmed TB infection. This is the case 
even in HIV infected persons 

2.  Exclude active TB disease. Patients should be screened to exclude active TB disease using 

standard TB screening methods. 

3.  In  principle,  any  effective  TB  chemotherapeutic  agent  can  be  used.  However,  the  greatest 
experience  is  with  Isoniazid  as  monotherapy  or  Isoniazid  and  Rifampicin  combination. 
Commonly Isoniazid monotherapy is used and is called Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT).

2.4.4 Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) 

IPT  is  currently  strongly  advocated  by  NTLP  for  all  HIV  positive  persons  and  under  5  child 
contacts  of  patients  with  active  TB.  NTLP  has  published  an  IPT  health  workers  guide  to  assist 
health  workers  in  initiating  IPT.  Health  workers  should  consult  this  guide  when  considering 
initiating IPT. It is important that before IPT is initiated that active TB is excluded. This is done to 
avoid monotherapy for active TB because TB should always be treated with combination therapy. 

The following key points from the IPT guidelines need to always be remembered:  

1.  Adults and adolescents living with HIV should be screened for TB using the four symptom 
screening  tool  for  TB  in  PLHIV.  Those  who  do  not  report  any  one  of  the  symptoms  of 
current cough, fever, weight loss, or night sweats are unlikely to have active TB. And those 
unlikely to have active TB upon screening should be offered Isoniazid preventive therapy.  
2.  Adults  and  adolescents  living  with  HIV  who  report  any  one  of  the  symptoms  of  current 
cough, fever, weight loss, or night sweats may have active TB. These individuals should be 
evaluated for TB and other diseases.  

3.   Adults and adolescents living with HIV who are unlikely to have active TB should receive 
at least six months of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT). This should be irrespective of:  

     The degree of immune suppression,  

     Whether the patient is on antiretroviral therapy or not,  

     Whether the patient is pregnant or not.  

4.   A Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) is not a requirement for initiating IPT in PLHIV.  
5.   PLHIV  who  have  a  positive  TST  benefit  more  from  IPT.  TST  should  be  used  where 

feasible to identify such individuals.  

6.  Providing  IPT  to  PLHIV  does  not  increase  the  risk  of  developing  Isoniazid  resistant  TB. 
Therefore,  concerns  regarding  the  development  of  Isoniazid  resistance  should  not  be  a 
barrier to providing IPT.  

7.  Children living with HIV who do not have any one of the following symptoms: poor weight 

gain, fever, or current cough are unlikely to have active TB.  

8.  Children living with HIV who have any one of the following symptoms: poor weight gain, 

fever, current cough or contact history with a TB case may have TB.  

These children should be evaluated for TB and other conditions.  

If the evaluation shows no TB, such children should be offered IPT except if they less than 1 
year. Children less than 1 year can be offered IPT if they are active TB contacts.  

9.  Children living with HIV who are more than 12 months of age:  

For those who  are unlikely to  have active TB and have no contact  with a TB  case should 
receive six months of IPT (10 mg/kg/day).  

10. Children living with HIV who less than 12 months are of age (infants):  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        37 

 
This group should only receive IPT if there is a history of contact with a TB case and they 
have no active TB.  

11. All children under five years:  

Those who have a history of contact with a TB case should be screened for active TB using 
the Intensified TB Case Finding Guide.  

Those who have no symptoms and signs suggestive of active TB should receive six months 
of IPT.  

2.4.5 IPT in special situations 

a)  Pregnancy 

IPT is safe in pregnancy and therefore pregnancy should not be used to exclude women living 
with  HIV/AIDS  from  symptom  based  screening  and  receiving  IPT.  More  still,  IPT  therapy 
should be completed even if the woman becomes pregnant while still on IPT treatment. 

b)  Contacts of MDR-TB and XDR-TB  

Primary or secondary prophylaxis with IPT is not applicable for the case of MDR or XDR-
TB  contacts  or  persons  previously  treated  for  MDR  or  XDR-TB  irrespective  of  their  HIV 
status.  Strict  clinical  observation  and  close  monitoring  for  the  development  of  active  TB 
disease  for  at  least  two  years  and  application  of  TB  infection  control  measures  at  home  as 
well  as  instituting  effective  therapy  for  the  index  case  are  preferred  over  the  provision  of 
MDR-TB or XDR-TB preventive therapy 

c)  Injecting drug users 

Use of IPT among injecting drug users should be undertaken after screening for active TB 
combined with harm reduction to minimize chances of acquisition of HIV and hepatitis. In 
this  group  of  patients,  HIV  and  hepatitis  screening  is  always  recommended.  Referral  for 
specialized care should be done in case of positive results for HIV or hepatitis. 

2.4.6 Monitoring IPT therapy for toxicity and adverse events  

IPT associated adverse drug reactions are minor and occur rarely. Close monitoring is needed for 
early detection of these adverse events. The major categories of drug-specific adverse reactions that 
can  occur  with  IPT  are  hepatic  and  peripheral  nerve  damage.  Some  hepatic  damage  is  mild 
presenting  as  asymptomatic  elevation  of  serum  liver  enzyme  concentrations  while  others  can 
present with a full   blown picture of hepatotoxicity. 

The  following  symptoms  should  raise  suspicion  of  hepatotoxicity  in  a  patient  on  IPT:  anorexia, 
nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  discomfort,  persistent  fatigue  or  weakness,  dark-colored  urine,  pale 
stools  or 
laboratory  measurements  of  serum  aspartate 
aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  and  bilirubin  is  strongly  recommended  among 

jaundice.  Baseline  and  periodic

individuals  with  history  of  liver  disease;  regular  use  of  alcohol;  chronic  liver  disease;  HIV 
infection; age more than 35 years; and pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period (i.e., within 
three months of delivery).  

2.4.7 Factors facilitating IPT therapy adherence and completion 

Adherence  to  the  full  course  and  completion  of  therapy  are  important  determinants  of  clinical 
benefit to the individual as well as to the success of the program. Therefore, during monthly follow-
ups,  the  provider  should  encourage  adherence,  address  side  effects,  provide  incentives  where 
possible,  educate  the  patient  to  minimize  stigma  and  ensure  active  TB  disease  is  not  present. 
However, initial follow up at two weeks following IPT initiation to check for side effects, patient’s 
understanding and to reinforce adherence is recommended 

If an individual on IPT develops active TB, IPT therapy must immediately be stopped and instead, 
a fully-fledged appropriate TB regimen is provided based on the patient’s TB category.

2.5 TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS 

2.5.1 Pregnancy  

The number of pregnant women with TB has increased because of the current HIV epidemic. The 
clinical  presentation  of  TB  in  pregnancy  is  like  non-pregnant  women.  Therefore,  all  pregnant 
women should be screened and tested for TB using the same TB screening tools available. Where 
possible the chest x-ray should be avoided. If a mother delivers a presumptive TB patient and other 
diagnostics  tests  have  failed,  the  placenta  should  be  examined  for  presence  of  calcifications.  If 
calcifications  are  present,  endometrial  tissue  should  be  obtained  and  sent  for  histology  for  TB.  It 
has been shown to grow MTB and may have histological features of TB. 

Undiagnosed  TB  in  pregnancy  is  associated  with  poorer  perinatal  infant  outcomes.  Particularly 
disseminated  TB,  military  TB  and  TB  meningitis  have  been  associated  with  worse  peri-natal 
outcomes. Once a diagnosis of TB is made, treatment should be promptly started because untreated 
TB presents a much greater risk than toxic effects to the baby. On the other hand, after diagnosing 
TB  in  a  woman,  it  is  recommended  to  inquire  about  pregnancy.  This  is  to  ensure  that  she  is  not 
given  any drug(s) that  may be considered unsafe in  pregnancy.  Fortunately, the first-line  anti-TB 
drugs – Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol – are safe in pregnancy.  

The NTLP-recommended regimen of 2RHZE/4RH for susceptible TB is safe for use in pregnancy. 
In  case  of  drug  resistant  TB,  the  clinician  should  evaluate  the  patients  to  assess  the  clinical 
condition  of  the  patient.  In  patients  in  who  the  clinical  condition  is  not  life  threatening  drug 
resistant  TB  treatment  should  be  started  preferably  in  the  second  trimester.  Aminoglycosides 
injectable  drugs  and  Ethionamide  should  be  avoided  as  much  as  possible.  Aminoglycoside  cause 
ototoxicity  in  the  foetus.  Ethionamide  causes  severe  nausea  and  has  been  associated  with 
teratogenic effects. 

All  pregnant  women  diagnosed  with  TB  should  be  screened  for  HIV  and  if  positive  managed 
according to national TB-HIV management guidelines. 

2.5.2 Breastfeeding 

 A  breastfeeding  woman  who  has  TB  should  be  treated  with  a  full  course  of  a  standard  regimen 
recommended by the NTLP. The concern here is to find out if the child already has TB disease or is 
just a contact likely to be infected by the mother. Concentrations of anti-TB drugs in breast milk are 
too low to prevent or treat TB in infants. The child should therefore be investigated for TB disease 
and, if found to have TB disease, must be given full course of anti-TB treatment. If the child does 
not  have  TB  disease,  give  Isoniazid  preventive  therapy  (10mg/kg  body  weight)  for  6  months. 
Mother and child should stay together and breastfeeding should continue normally but standard TB 
infection  prevention  measures  are  recommended.  BCG  vaccination  of  the  child  should  then  be 
postponed until the end of Isoniazid preventive therapy.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        40 

 
2.5.3 Treatment in Patients with Liver Disease 

Patient can have pre-existing liver disease or develop it as a toxicity of TB drugs. 

In  patients  with  liver  failure,  a  regimen  without  Rifampicin  may  be  used.  Streptomycin  and 
Ethambutol  may  be  used  if  treatment  is  necessary  for  patients  with  severe  liver  disease.  These 
patients should be referred to higher level of care for specialised management.  

2.5.4 Treatment of patients with drug induced liver injury  

Suspect liver damage when a patient on anti-TB drugs has developed jaundice plus or minus other 
symptoms of liver injury such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. If patients develop signs of 
liver  damage  during  TB  treatment,  it  is  advisable  to  check  liver  function  in  the  laboratory  if 
facilities  are  available.  If  the  liver  enzymes  (ALT/AST)  are  elevated  more  than  three  times  the 
normal upper limit, all medications including non-TB medications should be discontinued and the 
patient  monitored  until  the  enzymes  normalise.  Then  the  drugs  can  be  reinitiated.  There  are 
different  algorithms  for  reinitiating  drugs.  However,  the  principal  is  to  avoid  or  titrate  the 
introduction of the most hepatotoxic drugs- Pyrazinamide and Isoniazid.

2.5.5 Treatment of Patients with Renal Failure 

Isoniazid,  Rifampicin,  and  Pyrazinamide  may  be  given  in  normal  dosage  to  patients  with  renal 
failure, since these drugs are eliminated almost entirely by biliary excretion or are metabolised into 
non-toxic  compounds.  Patients  with  severe  renal  failure  who  are  receiving  Isoniazid  should  also 
receive pyridoxine to prevent peripheral neuropathy. These patients should be referred to a higher 
level of care for further management.  

2.5.6 Use of Contraceptives  

Rifampicin  interacts  with  estrogen-containing  contraceptives  and  reduces  the  blood  levels  of 
estrogen.  This  leads  to  the  reduced  protective  efficacy  of  the  contraceptives  and  may  result  in 
unplanned  pregnancy.  Therefore,  contraceptive  pills  with  higher  doses  of  estrogen,  such  as 
NewFem or Ovral, are recommended. Avoid use of contraceptive medications with low amount of 
estrogen  (e.g.,  Lo-femenal,  SoftSure).  Alternatively,  another  method  of  form  of  barrier 
contraception should be used or added. 

2.5.7 Bone, Joint, and Spinal Tuberculosis 

TB can virtually affect any tissue in the body. TB infects bone, joint tissues and the spine. TB of 
these  tissues  requires  extended  TB  treatment  durations  longer  than  the  standard  six  months. 
Although the duration varies from country to country, it is believed that treatment durations of 6-9 
months  are  as  effective  as  longer  duration  of  up  to  18  months.  Therefore  a  9-months  regimen  is 
preferred.  There  is  additional  benefit  of  surgical  debridement  in  combination  with  chemotherapy 
compared with chemotherapy alone for spinal tuberculosis. As such, uncomplicated cases of spinal 
tuberculosis  are  managed  with  medical  rather  than  surgical  treatment.  However,  based  on  expert 
opinion,  surgery  can  be  considered  in  situations  in  which  (1)  there  is  poor  response  to 
chemotherapy  with  evidence  of  ongoing  infection  or  ongoing  deterioration;  (2)  relief  of  cord 
compression is needed in patients with persistence or recurrence of neurologic deficits; or (3) there 
is  instability  of  the  spine.  Spinal  tuberculosis  with  evidence  of  meningitis  is  managed  as 
tuberculous meningitis, including consideration of adjunctive corticosteroids (Refer to table 2.3.3) 

2.5.8 TB Meningitis 

TB  meningitis  requires  longer  duration  of  treatment  than  TB  in  pulmonary  site.  The  range  of 
duration is 9-12 months. The usual regimens of TB treatment are used.  However, a choice can be 
made  between  ethambutol  and  an  injectable  aminoglycoside.  In  adults,  ethambutol  is  usually 
sufficient. In children, there is preference for an aminoglycoside. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy 
recommended in the treatment of TB meningitis with dexamethasone or prednisolone tapered over 
6–8 weeks for patients.

    Drug  resistant-TB  (DR-TB)  is  a  more  complicated  form  of  TB  to  manage  and  poses  an 

obstacle to effective TB care and prevention. 

  Four different forms of DR-TB are recognized depending on their pattern of resistance. 
  Non-adherence and inadequate TB treatment are the most important factors causing DR-TB. 
  DR-TB is confirmed by drug susceptibility testing or by using WHO endorsed molecular tests. 
  Treatment of DR-TB is using standardized MDR treatment regimen. 
  Groups  of  first-line  and  second-line  drugs  are  used  for  DR-TB  treatment  in  ambulatory  or 

health facility setting.

2.6 DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS 

2.6.1 Magnitude of Drug Resistant-Tuberculosis 

According  to  the  Uganda  Drug  resistance  survey  2010,  the  prevalence  of  MDR-TB  among  newly 
diagnosed TB (Primary MDR-TB) patients was 1.4 %. Among previously treated patients  Isoniazid 
resistance occurred in 21.1%, Rifampicin resistance was detected in 12.1%.  

2.6.2 Definition of Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB) 

Drug  resistance  is  said  to  occur  when  TB  organisms  continue  to  grow  in  the  presence  of  one  or 
more anti-TB drugs. 

Forms of drug-resistant tuberculosis 

  Mono-resistance: resistance to one first line anti-tuberculosis drug 
  Poly-resistance: resistance to more than one than one first line anti-tuberculosis drug, other 

than both Isoniazid and Rifampicin 

  Multidrug-resistance:  resistance to at least Rifampicin and Isoniazid. 
  Pre-  Extensive  drug-resistance:  Multi  drug-resistance  plus 

to  any 
fluoroquinolone  or  any  one  injectable  second-line  drug  (Amikacin,  Capreomycin, 
Kanamycin). 

resistance 

  Extensively drug-resistance: Multi drug-resistance plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone 

and any one injectable second-line drug (Amikacin, Capreomycin, Kanamycin). 

2.6.3 Risk Factors for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis 

Although several factors can contribute to the development of drug-resistant TB, inadequate anti-
TB  treatment  is  probably  the  most  important.  Inadequate  anti-TB  treatment  leads  to  mutation  in 
drug-susceptibility bacilli making them drug resistant. Overgrowth of initially drug-resistant bacilli 
also occurs when inadequate anti-TB treatment is used. Below are situations of inadequate anti-TB 
treatment:   

Inadequate drug regimen 
Inadequate duration of treatment 

 
 
  Drugs not taken regularly by the patient 
  Use of poor quality drugs 

Factors  causing  inadequate  anti-TB  treatment  can  be  grouped  into  health  provider  factors,  drug 
factors and patient factors.

2.6.4 Diagnosis of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis 

When  to  suspect  drug  resistance;  Suspect  drug-resistant  TB  under  the  following  circumstances 
(Risk groups):  

  Contact with known drug-resistant tuberculosis 
  Relapses 
  Treatment after failures 
  Return after loss to follow up 
  History of frequent interruption of drug treatment 
  HIV-positive patient presumed to have TB 
  Patients  who  remain  sputum  smear-positive  at  month  2  or  3  months  of  first-line  anti-TB 

treatment  

  Health care workers 
  Patients from prisons or other congregate settings 
  Chronic  cases  (still  sputum  smear-positive  after  completing  a  supervised  retreatment 

regimen)

Failures  of  retreatment  regimen  are  defined  as  patients  who 
remain  sputum  smear-positive  at  the  end  of  a  supervised 
retreatment  regimen.  These  patients  have  the  highest  MDR-
TB rates of any group, often approaching 90%. 
Most  studies  have  shown  that  close  contacts  of  MDR-TB 
patients have very high rates of MDR-TB.  
Failures  of  Category  1  are  patients  who  while  on  treatment 
are  sputum  smear-positive  at  month  5  or  later  during  the 
course  of  treatment.  Category  1  failures  where  Rifampicin 
was  used  in  the  continuation  phase  and  DOT  was  not  used 
throughout treatment are at higher risk for MDR-TB. 
This  group  of  patients  is  at  risk  for  DR-TB,  rates  can  vary 
considerably. 

Cases  of  relapse  or  return  after  loss  to  follow-up  with  a 
history  of  erratic  anti-TB  drug  use  may  be  more  strongly 
associated  with  risk  for  DR-TB.  Early  relapses  are  also 
associated with DR-TB.

Exposure in institutions that have 
DR-TB  outbreaks  or  a  high  DR-
TB  prevalence  (includes  health-
care workers) 

HIV-positive patient presumed to 
have TB 

Prisoners and health-care workers in health facilities can have 
high rates of DR-TB. 

It  is  strongly  recommended  that  all  individuals  with  HIV-
associated  TB  have  DST  to  rule  out  DR-TB  to  avoid  high 
rates  of  mortality  due  to  unrecognized  DR-TB  in  these 
patients. 

Laboratory testing for DR-TB  
Patients  presumed  to  have  DR-TB  should  be  screened  using  a  nucleic  acid  amplification  test 
(NAAT)  such  as  Xpert  MTB/Rif  or  the  Line  Probe  Assay  (LPA)  which  detects  genetic 
determinants of resistance. Definitive diagnosis of drug resistance is made microbiologically after 
culture  and  DST  has  been  done  in  the  laboratory.  All  patients  who  are  presumed  to  have  drug-
resistant TB should therefore have sputum/other specimens taken for culture and DST in vivo.  

2.6.5 Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis  

Initiation of MDR TB Treatment and any modification of such treatment should be done by DR TB 
Expert Review Panels in DR-TB treatment initiation centers. Treatment of DR-TB depends on the 
resistance  pattern;  whether  it  is  mono-  or  poly-  resistance  or  whether  it  is  multi-  or  extensively 
resistance.  Treatment  of  patients  with  mono-  or  poly  resistance  using  short  course  chemotherapy 
has  been  associated  with  increased  treatment  failure  and  further  acquisition  of  drug  resistance. 
Treatment  regimens  should  be  constructed  for  these  patients  based  on  DST  patterns.  The  most 
effective  treatment  regimens  shall  be  reviewed  by  specialists  and  approved  by  Expert  Review 
Panels in the DR-TB treatment initiation centers. 

For  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  MDR-TB  or  XDR-TB,  treatment  should  be  started  as  soon  as 
possible.  

Treatment regimen for DR TB 

Standardized  treatment:  This  is  when  DR-TB  regimens  are  designed  based  on  DST  data  from 
representative patient populations, and all patients in a defined group or category receive the same 
regimen.  This  is  usually  done  in  the  absence  of  individualized  DST  and  may  be  changed  once 
individual  results  are  available.  Standard  regimen  should  be  used 
to 
fluoroquinolones and injectable agents is documented (or almost certain) 

if  susceptibility 

Empirical treatment:   Is when each regimen is individually designed based on the patient’s past 
history of TB treatment  and DST data from the representative patient population.  Commonly, an 
empirical regimen is adjusted when DST on the individual patient becomes available.  Practically, 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        48 

 
each regimen is designed based on the patient’s previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment and 
individual index case’s DST results. 
Individualized Treatment: Is when each regimen is designed based on the patient’s past history of 
TB treatment and individual DST results.  

Duration of MDR-TB treatment 

Treatment  of  MDR  TB  requires  long  periods  than  susceptible  TB.  The  treatment  duration  ranges 
from  9-20 months depending on the regimen  and response to  treatment.  Based on duration MDR 
TB regimens can be classified as shorter MDR TB regimens or Conventional MDR TB regimens 

Shorter  MDR-TB  regimens:  These  regimens  are  for  patients  with  rifampicin-resistant  or 
multidrug-resistant TB who have not been previously treated with second-line drugs and in whom 
resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable agents has been excluded or is considered 
highly unlikely, the shorter MDR-TB regimen is 9-12 months. 

Conventional  MDR-TB  regimens:  These  regimens  last  up  to  20  months  and  the  ones  that  have 
been used for the longest time until the shorter regimens were developed. 

Treatment phases 

The treatment of MDR TB like drug susceptible TB is divided into two phases: intensive phase and 
continuation  phase.  Characteristic  of  intensive  phase  is  the  injectable  drug  and  the  continuation 
phase has only oral medication. 

RR/MDR-TB:  Intensive phase duration 

  The intensive phase (duration of injectable anti-TB drug use) should be at least 6 months 

and at least 4months post-culture conversion* (whichever is longer).  

  For standardized regimen, this injectable phase includes an injectable given six days a week 

and four oral drugs given seven days a week. 

  For short course regimen, the intensive phase is for 4-6 months 

RR/MDR-TB: continuation phase duration 

  For standardized regimen, the continuation phase is 14 months and includes four oral drugs 

given seven days a week. 

  For short course regimen, continuation is 5 months 

*Culture conversion is defined as the first month of two consecutive negative cultures taken at least 
30 days apart.

2.6.6 Classes and Groups of anti-tuberculosis drugs  

Anti-TB  drugs  have  traditionally  been  divided  into  first-  and  second-line  agents  with  isoniazid, 
rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin being the primary first-line anti-TB drugs.  

A new classification system  for second line drugs  using  an A-D-group system based on efficacy, 
experience of use, safety, and drug class (but not all medications in the same group come from the 
same drug class or have the same efficacy or safety). In this new group system  streptomycin, has 
been added to the second line injectable agents. Not all medications listed below are available for

5  HIV-status must be tested and confirmed to be negative before thioacetazone is started 

Anti-TB  drugs  listed  above  that  are  not  currently  available  in  Uganda  include:,  gatifloxacin, 
prothionamide,  terizidone,  delamanid,  ,  imipenem/cilastatin,  meropenem,  and  thioacetazone. 
Bedaquiline is now available.  

Group A: Fluoroquinolones  

Fluoroquinolones  are  often  the  most  effective  anti-TB  drugs  in  a  MDR-TB  regimen.  Important 
recommendations include: 

  A fluoroquinolone should be used for all MDR-TB cases if susceptible (or felt likely to have 
efficacy). Recent meta-analyses have found a significant association with cure for MDR-TB 
treatment when fluoroquinolones are included in the regimen. 

  A  later-generation  fluoroquinolone  (levofloxacin  or  moxifloxacin)  rather  than  an  earlier-
generation  fluoroquinolone  (Ofloxacin)  should  be  used  if  available.  Recent  meta-analyses 
also  supports  a  stronger  association  with  cure  using  later-generation  (moxifloxacin  and 
levofloxacin) over early-generation (Ofloxacin) fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin is included 
in the standardized MDR-TB regimen. 

  Ciprofloxacin  has  weaker  efficacy  against  TB  than  other  fluoroquinolones  and  is  not 

recommended to be used as an anti-TB drug.  

  Gatifloxacin  is  associated  with  serious  cases  of  hypoglycemia,  hyperglycemia  and  new 

onset diabetes, and due to these safety issues is not recommended for use. 

  The  fluoroquinolones  are  known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval.  QT  interval  prolongation 
predisposes to Torsades de Pointes, which may result in sudden death. There is variability 
between  the  fluoroquinolones  in  this  effect;  however,  the  prolongation  is  considered 
minimal. Additional cardiac monitoring is required when used with other medications that 
prolong the QT interval (e.g. bedaquiline, clofazimine or clarithromycin). Moxifloxacin has 
more effect on QT prolongation than levofloxacin and ofloxacin. 

Group B: Injectable anti-TB drugs  

All patients should receive a second-line Group B injectable agent in the intensive phase of MDR-
TB treatment unless resistance is documented or highly suspected. 

  Either  kanamycin,  amikacin,  or  capreomycin  can  be  used  as  a  first  choice  if  all  meet  the 

criteria of likely to be effective. 

  Kanamycin  and  amikacin  have  lower  costs  than  capreomycin,  have  less  ototoxicity  than 
streptomycin  and  have  been  used  extensively  for  the  treatment  of  DR-TB  throughout  the 
world.  Limited  evidence  suggests  capreomycin  has 
the 
aminoglycosides. 

less  ototoxicity 

than 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        51 

 
 

If an isolate is resistant to both streptomycin and kanamycin, or if DST data show high rates 
of resistance to amikacin and kanamycin, then capreomycin is suggested as the injectable of 
choice or bedaquiline may be considered as a substitute. 

  Given the high rates of streptomycin resistance in patients with MDR-TB (greater than 50% 
is some countries) and extensive use as a first-line agent in many countries, streptomycin is 
not  often  used  in  MDR  regimens.  The  exception  would  be  if  strain  is  resistant  to  all  the 
second-line  anti-TB  injectable  agents  (amikacin,  kanamycin,  and  capreomycin),  but  it  is 
susceptible to streptomycin and there are alternative drugs to build an effective regimen. 

All of the Group B medications are given intramuscularly (IM). Most commonly, the medications 
are deeply injected into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal  muscle. Additionally, they can be 
given intravenously (IV), however, they must be given slowly (over 60 minute period). 

Group C: Other core second-line agents  

Ethionamide compared to prothionamide  are similar in  efficacy  and side-effects.  Of the Group C 
medications,  ethionamide/prothionamide  performed  the  best  in  the  meta-analysis  of  MDR-TB 
treatment (2011 WHO guidelines). 

  Cycloserine should be included in MDR regimens. Cycloserine shares no cross-resistance to 

other anti-TB drugs.  

  Since  the  combination  of  ethionamide/prothionamide  and  PAS  often  causes  a  high 
incidence  of  gastrointestinal  side  effects  and  hypothyroidism,  these  agents  are  usually  not 
used together. PAS is now an Add-on agent in Group D3.  

  Group C medications may be started at a low dose and escalated over 3 to 10 days to reduce 

frequency or severity of side effects (dose-ramping, see section 6.4.1). 

D. Add-on agents (not part of the core MDR-TB regimen) 

Group D1:  
Consists of pyrazinamide, ethambutol and high-dose isoniazid.  These agents  are usually added to 
the  core  second-line  medications,  unless  the  risks  from  confirmed  resistance,  pill  burden  and 
intolerance or drug-drug interaction outweigh potential benefits.  

  Pyrazinamide  is  routinely  added  to  MDR-TB  regimens  unless  there  is  a  reasonable  clinical 
contraindication  for  its  use  (hepatotoxicity  or  other  serious  adverse  effect).  DST  to 
pyrazinamide is not reliable and for this reason it is considered an acceptable practice to use 
pyrazinamide in a regimen even when a laboratory result demonstrates resistance.  

  Many  DR-TB  patients  have  chronically  inflamed  lungs,  which  theoretically  produce  the 
acidic  environment  in  which  pyrazinamide  is  more  effective.  For  these  reasons, 
pyrazinamide  is  included  for  the  entire  duration  of  treatment  in  the  standard  MDR-TB 
regimen. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        52 

 
  Due to difficulties in testing, Ethambutol is often not considered a key medication in a MDR-
TB  regimen,  even  if  results  suggest  susceptibility.  It  is  not  routinely  added  to  MDR-TB 
regimens, however, it can be added if the criteria of it being a likely effective medication are 
met (see Box 6.1 for criteria of a likely effective medications) 

  For patients with strains resistant to low concentrations of isoniazid but susceptible to higher 

concentrations, the use of high-dose isoniazid may have some benefit. 

Group D2:   
Made up of bedaquiline and delamanid, two new drugs which have been released in recent  years. 
The NTLP has accessed bedaquiline and hopes to introduce delamanid in the future.  

Group D3:  
Consists  of  p-aminosalicylic  acid  (PAS),  imipenem-cilastatin,  meropenem,  clavulanate  and 
thioacetazone. These drugs are only to be used when a MDR-TB regimen with at least 5 effective 
drugs  (i.e.  primarily  4  core  second-line  medicines  plus  pyrazinamide)  cannot  be  otherwise 
composed.  

2.6.7 How to build an MDR TB and XDR-TB regimen 

The treatment regimens for MDR-TB or XDR-TB are built based on first line drugs the patient is 
susceptible to drugs from different groups of second line drugs. At least a minimum of 5 drugs must 
be in the regimen 

The intensive phase of MDR-TB treatment is at least 6 months and the continuation phase is at least 
14 months. Based on the recent drug resistance survey, the recommended standardized regimens for 
MDR-TB and XDR-TB treatment in Uganda are displayed in table 2.16.  

A  health  worker  should  directly  observe  all  doses  of  MDR-TB/XDR-TB  treatment.  In  a  health 
facility where treatment is not possible, the patients should be referred to a health facility or DR-TB 
treatment initiation center where treatment can be initiated. Follow up treatment can be offered in 
an ambulatory setting at a health facility near the patient’s home or under home based care.  

Table 2.6.4: Stepwise approach to building an MDR-TB regimen  

STEP 1  Choose 

an 

injectable 

medication (Group B) 

Kanamycin 
Amikacin 
Capreomycin 

Choose  a  medication  based  on  DST  and  treatment  history.  Streptomycin  is  generally 
not used because of high rates of resistance in patients with MDR-TB. 

STEP 2  Choose  a  higher  generation 

fluoroquinolone (Group A) 

Levofloxacin 
Moxifloxacin 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        53 

 
 
  
Use  a  later  generation  fluoroquinolone.  If  Levofloxacin  (or  Ofloxacin)  resistance  is 
documented,  use  Moxifloxacin.  Avoid  Moxifloxacin 
if  possible  when  using 
Bedaquiline. 

STEP 3  Add Group C medications 

Cycloserine/Terizidone 
Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) 
Ethionamide/Prothionamide 

Add two or more Group C medications until you have at least 4 second-line anti-TB drugs likely to 
be  effective.  Ethionamide/Prothionamide  is  considered  the  most  effective  Group  4  medication. 
Consider  treatment  history,  side-effect  profile,  and  cost.  DST  is  not  considered  reliable  for  the 
medications in this group. Ethionamide and Cycloserine are preferred for use in Uganda. 
STEP 4  Add Group D1 medications  Pyrazinamide 

Ethambutol 

Pyrazinamide  is  routinely  added  in  most  regimens;  Ethambutol  can  be  added  if  the 
criteria for an effective medication are met. If susceptibility to Isoniazid is unknown or 
pending it can be added to the regimen until DST results become available. 

STEP 5  Add 

Group 

D2/3 

medications 

Bedaquiline 
Linezolid 
Delamanid 
Clofazimine 
Amoxicillin/ clavulanate 
Imipenem/cilastatin plus clavulanate 
Meropenem plus clavulanate 
High-dose Isoniazid 
Clarithromycin 
Thioacetazone  

Consider adding Group  5 medications  if there are not  four second-line anti-TB drugs 
that  are  likely  to  be  effective  from  Groups  2-4.  If  medications  are  needed  from  this 
group,  it  is  recommended  to  add  two  or  more.  DST  is  not  standardized  for  the 
medications in this group.

Monitoring MDR TB treatment response 

Patients should be monitored closely for signs of treatment failure. Standard monitoring should be 
performed following the recommended MDR TB treatment guidelines. 

Clinically,  the  most  important  way  to  monitor  response  to  treatment  is  through  regular  history-
taking and physical examination. The classic symptoms of TB  – cough, sputum production, fever 
and  weight  loss  –  generally  improve  within  the  first  few  months  of  treatment  and  should  be 
monitored  frequently  by  health-care  providers.  The  recurrence  of  TB  symptoms  after  sputum 
conversion, for example, may be the first sign of treatment failure. For children, height and weight 
should  be  measured  regularly  to  ensure  that  they  are  growing  normally.  A  normal  growth  rate 
should resume after a few months of successful treatment. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        56 

 
 
 
 
The  most  important  objective  evidence  of  improvement  is  conversion  of  the  sputum  smear  and 
culture  to  negative.  The  use  of  sputum  smear  microscopy  and  culture  rather  than  sputum  smear 
microscopy alone is recommended for the monitoring of patients with MDRTB during treatment  

Sputum conversion is slower in DR-TB than in drug-susceptible TB. Paucibacillary culture results 
should not be automatically regarded as negative when treating DR-TB. Acquired drug resistance 
and  treatment  failure  often  begin  with  the  growth  of  one  or  two  colonies  on  a  sputum  culture. 
Culture  conversion  should  not  be  considered  to  be  equivalent  to  cure.  A  certain  proportion  of 
patients may initially convert and later revert to positive sputum culture. Tests should be performed 
monthly before smear and culture conversion, with conversion defined as two consecutive negative 
smears and cultures taken 30 days apart. After conversion, the minimum period recommended for 
bacteriological monitoring is monthly for smears and bimonthly for cultures  
Specimens for monitoring do not need to be examined in duplicate, but doing so can increase  the 
sensitivity of the monitoring. 

For  patients  who  remain  smear-  and  culture-positive  during  treatment  or  who  are  suspects  for 
treatment failure, DST can be repeated. It is usually not necessary to repeat DST within less than 
three months of completion of treatment. Objective laboratory evidence of improvement often lags 
behind clinical improvement. 

The  chest  radiograph  may  be  unchanged  or  show  only  slight  improvement,  especially  in  re-
treatment patients with chronic pulmonary lesions. Chest radiographs should be taken at least every 
six months, when a surgical intervention is being considered, or whenever clinically indicated.

2.7 TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN 

2.7.1 Introduction 

It is estimated that there were 1 million new cases of TB among children accounting for 6.5% of the 
total new TB cases worldwide in 2014. Children accounted for 7% of global deaths due to TB in the 
same year.  In Uganda, 3316 (7.5% of the total new and relapse TB cases of all forms)  in children 
were notified to the TB program in 2014. However, this proportion falls short of the estimated 15% - 
20%.  Of  all  the  new  cases,  2570  (78%)  were  pulmonary  TB  (PTB),  and  746  (22%)  were  Extra 
Pulmonary TB (EPTB). Children accounted for 2% of the total 211 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB 
cases notified in 2014.  

TB  may  present  at  any  age  in  children  though  the  risk  is  highest  below  the  age  of  2  years.  When 
compared  to  adults,  children  are  more  prone  to  TB  infection,  TB  disease,  and  severe  forms  of  TB 
disease.  This  is  because  their  immune  system  is  not  fully  developed.  The  disease  in  children  is 
mainly  airborne  and  acquired  from  older  children  or  adults  most  especially  those  that  are  smear 
positive and not on effective treatment with whom they are in close contact. In rare cases, children 
may be born with TB (congenital TB) or acquire TB by drinking unpasteurized milk (Bovine TB).  

TB disease in children is mainly primary and is associated with a low bacillary load.  Older children 
and  adolescents  commonly  have  the  adult  type  of  disease  which  is  secondary  TB  and  is  due  to 
reactivation.  The commonest type of TB disease in children is pulmonary TB (75%). 

2.7.2 Risk factors for TB in children 

Risk factors for TB infection 
The risk factors for TB infection include: - 
a)  Contact with an infectious TB case (source case). The risk of infection is greater with; 

close contact 

- 
-  prolonged duration of contact. 
-  bacterial load of source case 
-  poor ventilation 

b)  Increased exposure in community 

Children who live  in  high TB  endemic communities  are more likely to  have TB infection than 
those in low TB endemic communities.  

Risk factors for TB disease 
Once exposed to a person with PTB disease, the following are risk factors for developing TB disease 
in children:  
a)  Age less than 5 years 

Younger children especially those aged less than 2 years have an increased risk of developing TB 
disease upon exposure and also severe forms of TB disease  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        58 

 
 
 
b)  HIV infection 
c)  Severe malnutrition particularly undernutrition 

Severe malnutrition is associated with impaired cell mediated immunity thereby predisposing to 
TB disease.  

d)  Recent episode of measles, pertussis  

Measles is associated with weakened immune system that puts a child at risk for developing TB 
disease. 

e)  Other  immune  suppressive  conditions  e.g.  diabetes,  children  on  chemotherapy,  prolonged 

steroid use 

Risk factors for severe TB disease 
a)  Young age mainly under one year 

Children  especially  those  under  the  age  of  1  year  are  at  a  higher  risk  for  severe  forms  of  TB 
disease such as TB meningitis. 

b)  Lack of BCG vaccination  

BCG vaccination is more effective against severe forms of TB particularly TBM  

2.7.3 Presentation of TB in children  

The following are the commonest symptoms of TB in children and therefore if any child presents 
with any, s/he has presumptive TB. The child should be evaluated for such. 

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 

Persistent Cough for two weeks or more  
Prolonged Fever for 2 weeks or more  
Poor weight  gain for 1 month or more: defined as weight loss, or very low weight 
(weight-for-age less than -3 z-score), or underweight (weight-for age less than -2 z-
score),  or  confirmed  weight  loss  (>5%)  since  the  last  visit,  or  growth  curve 
flattening, or Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) measurement in the red color 
code.   

(iv)  History of a close or household contact with an individual who has PTB.  
(v) 

Reduced playfulness, poor feeding or decreased activity in the presence of any of the 
above symptoms   

These symptoms are included on the ICF tool which is used to screen for TB in Uganda (figure 2.2a).  

Other symptoms of TB include painless enlarged cervical lymph nodes, Gibbus, haemoptysis in older 
children and adolescents.  All children meeting the criteria for presumptive TB, should be evaluated 
for  TB  irrespective  of  any  duration  of  treatment  for  cough;  treatment  for  fever  or  response  to 
nutritional rehabilitation.

2.7.4 Diagnosis of TB in children 

Although bacteriological confirmation of TB in children is not always possible, it should be sought 
for whenever possible. The main challenges are the pauci bacillary nature of TB in children and the 
difficulties of obtaining a good sputum or other specimen sample. Once a sample is obtained, order 
for  the  same  TB  tests  as  in  adults.  Complete  Blood  Count  (CBC)  and  Erythrocyte  Sedimentation 
Rate  (ESR)  are  nonspecific  and  are  NO  LONGER  recommended  as  part  of  routine  investigations 
used in the diagnosis of TB. The diagnosis of TB in children is dependent on conducting a detailed 
clinical assessment of TB including screening with the ICF tool, history taking including history of 
contact, clinical examination, and relevant  TB tests. The approach to diagnose TB in HIV infected 
children is similar to that in HIV uninfected children.  

Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) 
Unlike in adults where the diagnostic value of the TST for active TB is extremely limited, TST is a 
good  supportive  test  for  TB  diagnosis  in  children.  In  a  symptomatic  child,  with  no  documented 
evidence  of  TB  contact,  the  finding  of  a  positive  TST  strengthens  the  possibility  of  recent  TB 
exposure. Consider TST positive as below: 

  5 mm or more is positive if the child is: 

  HIV positive 
  Severely malnourished 
  Immunosuppressed  
  Having a recent measles or whooping cough episode 

  10 mm or more is positive in all children except the above listed category. 

2.7.5 Treatment of TB in Children 
The  principles  and  objectives  of  TB  treatment  are  similar  to  those  of  adults  (see  section  2.3).  In 
addition, effective treatment of TB in children promotes growth and development.  
All children diagnosed with TB will be treated with four medicines. The duration of treatment will be 
guided  by  the  site  of  disease.  TB  medicines  in  children  are  administered  per  kg  body  weight  and 
therefore the weight should be measured at each time of TB medicines refill.

Streptomycin  is  NOT  recommended for use in  the management of TB in children because of the 
associated side effects. Ethambutol is safe for use in children provided the recommended doses are 
adhered to.

Adjunct therapy 

1.  Pyridoxine is routinely given to children with severe malnutrition and HIV infected children 
at a dose of 12.5mg -25mg/ day during the anti TB medicines (INH) to prevent peripheral 
neuropathy.  

2.  Prednisolone is used in TB meningitis, and for complications of airway obstruction due TB 
lymph  node  enlargement.  The  dose  is  2mg/kg/day  as  a  single  dose  for  4weeks,  and  then 
reduced over a period of 1- 2weeks.  

2.7.6 Follow up of children on TB treatment 

Children on TB treatment should be followed up every 2 weeks in the first month of treatment and 
thereafter every month until treatment completion. It is important to measure the weight of the child 
at  each  clinic  visit  in  order  to  make  dose  adjustments.  Monitoring  of  TB  treatment  in  children  is 
summarized in the box 2.5 below. 

Box 2.4 Monitoring TB treatment in children 

Monitoring TB treatment in children  

 Follow up the child every 2 weeks in first month of intensive phase and then monthly up to end 

of continuation phase 

 Weigh the child at each follow-up, document and adjust dosage if necessary 
 Check with caretaker regarding treatment adherence. 

 Explain  and  emphasize  to  care-giver  and  child  why  they  must  take  the  full  course  of 

treatment even if they are feeling better 

 Note  risk  factors  for  poor  adherence  such  as  distance/transport;  orphan  (especially  if 
mother  has  died)  or  primary  care-giver  unwell;  adolescents’  education  and  adherence 
support especially if has TB/HIV 

 Explain that anti-TB drugs in children are well tolerated and safe. 
  CXR is not required in follow-up if the child is responding well to anti-TB treatment 

 Most children with TB will start to show signs of improvement after 2 to 4 weeks of anti-TB 

 Treatment. Therefore, assessment at 1-2 months after for treatment failure. If no, poor 

adherence, consider treatment failure if a child has: 

o  No symptom resolution or if symptoms are getting worse 
o  Continued weight loss 
o  Smear-positive at 2-month follow-up sputum 

 On every follow up visit, monitor for hepatitis; the most important adverse effect, which usually 

presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting and tender, enlarged liver. 

 Monitor for opportunistic infections if TB-HIV infected on every visit

distress and TB spine with neurological complications  
Severe malnutrition - for nutritional rehabilitation 
Severe pneumonia (i.e. chest in-drawing) 

ii. 
iii. 
iv.  Other  co-morbidities  e.g.  severe  anemia,  liver  disease,  renal  disease  Severe  adverse 

reactions such as hepatotoxicity 

v.  Retreatment/relapses where bacteriological confirmation is not determined 

2.7.7 Prevention of TB in children 

The following are approaches used to prevent TB in children. 

2.7.7.1 BCG 

The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is administered to all new born babies according to 
the national Program of Immunizations (EPI) guidelines. The vaccine is only effective in protecting 
against  severe  forms  of  TB  with  an  overall  efficacy  against  TB  of  50%  and  80%  efficacy  in 
preventing  TB  meningitis.  BCG  should  not  be  administered  to  children  with  confirmed  HIV 
infection because of the associated BCG disease and its related mortality in that population.  

2.7.7.2 IPT 

Isoniazid  is  effective  in  preventing  TB  disease  among  child  contacts  of  individuals  with  PTB  and 
people  living  with  HIV.    It  is  important  to  note  that  contacts  of  MDR  PTB  patients  should  NOT 
receive IPT. IPT is recommended for the following categories of patients for 6 months at a dose of 
10mg/kg concurrently with pyridoxine upon exclusion of active TB. 

a)  All  children  under  the  age  of  5  years  with  a  positive  history  of  contact  with  a  patient  with 

active TB 

b) All HIV positive children and adults in whom TB signs and symptoms have been excluded. 
HIV positive children under 12 months of age with a positive history of contact with a patient 
with active TB. 

2.7.7.3 CONTACT SCREENING AND MANAGEMENT  

Contact screening (contact tracing) is a systematic process for identifying TB contacts that have TB 
or are at risk of developing TB.  

Contact screening comprises of contact identification and prioritization is a process that includes: - 

a)  Interviewing the index TB case to obtain contact information (e.g. name, age) 
b)  Assessment of contacts’ risk of having TB or developing TB.

The following are the categories of TB cases that should be prioritized for contact screening. 

i.  Bacteriologically confirmed PTB 
ii.  MDR-TB or XDR-TB (proven or suspected) 
iii. 
iv.  Child <5 years of age 

Person living with HIV 

2.7.8 Children with TB and HIV 

The  principles  and  approach  to  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  follow  up  of  TB  in  children  mentioned 
above apply to HIV infected children. Cough of any duration in an HIV positive child should trigger 
evaluation for TB. Once a diagnosis of TB is made, TB treatment should be initiated irrespective of 
Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) status.  In addition to TB treatment, all children who are co-infected 
with  TB  and  HIV  should  receive  the  comprehensive  HIV  care  package  including  Anti-Retroviral 
Therapy  (ART)  and  Co-trimoxazole  Preventive  Therapy  (CPT).  In  addition,  it  is  important  to 
schedule the TB and HIV clinic appointments on the same day to enhance adherence and minimize 
loss to follow up. A child on TB-ART co-treatment requires close monitoring for side effects of both 
anti-TB  medicines  and  ART.  The  tables  below  summarize  the  ART  regimen  for  children  with 
TB/HIV co-infection

regimen: Substitute with EFV      

*For  children  on  triple  NRTI,  switch  back  to  initial  /  preferred  regimen  once  TB  medication  is 
completed  

2.7.10 TB Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome  

Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) is an inflammatory process characterized by 
transient  worsening  of  clinical  disease  following  initiation  of  treatment  due  to  restoration  of  the 
body’s immunity. Onset is usually within the first 3 months after starting ART.  

Risk factors for TB IRIS include; low baseline CD4 count, extensive TB disease, early initiation of 
ART,  and  rapid  immunological  and  virological  responses  to  ART.  Symptoms  of  TB  IRIS  include 
worsening  TB  symptoms  and  CXR  features,  new  and  persistent  fevers  after  starting  ART,  and 
evidence  of  local  and/or  systemic  infection  or  inflammation  (e.g.  enlarging  lymph  nodes  and  the 
development of fistulae and cold abscesses). 

When IRIS is detected; the following actions should be taken: 
 Rule out TB/HIV treatment failure, side effects of TB and HIV treatment, and preexisting untreated 
opportunistic infections.  

(i)  Continue  both  ART  and  anti-TB  treatment  unless  severe  toxicity  is  suspected  or 
confirmed  (e.g.,  elevated  LFTs).  Give  prednisolone  at  a  dose  of  1-2mg/kg  for  1  to2 
weeks; and thereafter, gradually decrease the dose.  

(ii)  Provide other supportive measures as needed.

2.8 TB/HIV CO-INFECTION 

2.8.1 Introduction 

HIV is the strongest risk factor for developing tuberculosis (TB) disease in those with latent or new 
Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  infection.    The  risk  of  developing  TB  disease  is  between  20  and  37 
times greater in people living with HIV (PLHIV) than among those who do not have HIV infection.  
TB  is  the  leading  cause  of  HIV-related  hospitalization  and  mortality-accounting  for  around  one 
quarter (27%, with range of 20-34%) of deaths among hospitalized HIV-positive adults, and almost a 
third (30%, with range of 11-49%) of deaths among HIV-positive children (WHO HIV/TB update, 
2015). At present in Uganda, an estimated 45% of TB patients are also infected with HIV. While less 
than 1% of HIV patients in care are diagnosed with TB- far below the expected range of 4-25%. 

In  response  to  the  above  situation,  the  Uganda  National  TB  and  AIDS  Control  Programs  work 
together to implement a set of collaborative TB/HIV activities to reduce the burden of TB in PLHV 
and reduce the burden of HIV in patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB. 

The Uganda MOH recommends TB and HIV services to be provided at a single facility at the same 
time and location (one-stop shop service).  A patient receives all the services they require during one 
consultation. It includes TB clinic providing HIV treatment and HIV clinic providing TB treatment.

2.8.2 TB prevention in HIV 

Intensified TB case-finding 
All  people  living  with  HIV  (children,  adolescents  &  adults),  wherever  they  receive  care  should  be 
regularly screened for TB using the Intensified TB Case Finding tool (Appendix 8.11) at every visit to 
the health facility or contact with a health worker. Intensified TB Case Finding (ICF) means regular 
screening of all people with or at high risk of TB in health facilities and congregate settings (prisons, 
military  barracks,  slums)  for  symptoms  and  signs  of  TB,  followed  promptly  with  diagnosis  and 
treatment, and then doing the same for household contacts. ICF is important, regardless of whether the 
HIV patient is receiving IPT or ART.  

ICF  facilitates  rapid  identification  of  presumptive  TB  patients  allowing  for  triage  and  other  steps  to 
reduce TB transmission. 

Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) 
In Uganda, IPT is offered to the following groups of people:  HIV-positive children, adolescents and 
adults. Before IPT is given active TB disease should be excluded. Furthermore, the combined use of 
Isoniazid  preventive  therapy  and  antiretroviral  therapy  among  people  living  with  HIV  significantly 
reduces the incidence of TB. IPT is therefore recommended irrespective of immune status and whether 
or not a person is on ART.  

However, when PLHIV have any one of the four symptoms (current cough, fever, weight loss or night 
sweats),  they  may  have  active  TB  and  should  be  evaluated  for  TB  and  other  diseases  prior  to  IPT 
initiation. IPT initiation should only be undertaken after active TB disease has been ruled out. 

Infection Control  
People  living  with  HIV  are  at  high  risk  of  acquiring  TB  in  health  care  facilities  and  congregate 
settings. Therefore, TB infection control practices should be implemented in these settings to reduce 
the risk of TB transmission.  

Each  health  care  facility  should  have  a  facility  TB  infection  control  plan  that  includes  managerial, 
administrative, environmental, personal protection measures. And should have a TB IC focal person. 

2.8.3 HIV/AIDS Care and Support in TB Clinics 

The provision of HIV/AIDS care in TB clinics is part of a continuum of a comprehensive AIDS care 
package.    The  package  includes  clinical  management  and  laboratory  support  (prophylaxis,  early 
diagnosis  of  TB  or  HIV/AIDS,  rational  treatment  and  follow-up  care  for  non-TB  opportunistic 
infections). Those who have completed their TB treatment should continue with HIV care service or 
be referred where such service can be offered.  

TB/HIV collaborative care aims to provide comprehensive care to the TB/HIV co-infected patient. As 
part of TB/HIV collaborative activities, the following should be planned and carried out in TB clinics: 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        67 

 
Provider Initiated HIV testing and counselling  
HIV  testing  of  patients  with  presumptive  and  diagnosed  TB  should  be  provider  initiated.  Provider-
initiated  testing  and  counselling  (PITC)  is  HIV  testing  and  counselling  offered  by  a  health-care 
provider  in  a  clinical  setting.  PITC  is  recommended  to  everyone  (all  adults  and  children)  with 
presumptive and diagnosed TB [9]. Provider-initiated testing and counselling should be voluntary and 
should be provided according to the national HIV counselling guidelines.   

HIV prevention methods in the TB clinics 
Health  workers  should  provide  HIV  prevention  messages  to  all  TB  patients.  Positive  living  among 
those already infected and safe sex practices, including provision and correct use of condoms should 
be emphasized in order to prevent spread within the community. All clients attending the TB clinics 
should  be  screened  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases  using  recommended  approaches.  Those  with 
symptoms of sexually transmitted infections should be treated or referred to an STD clinic. A referral 
linkage should be established within and between TB and HIV service provision points. 

Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) 
Routine  Co-trimoxazole  preventive  therapy  should  be  administered  to  all  HIV-infected  patients 
(including  children  and  pregnant  women)  with  active  TB  disease  regardless  of  CD4  cell  count.  Co-
trimoxazole preventive therapy should be implemented as an integral component of the TB-HIV care 
package  because  it  is  effective  in  reducing  new  WHO  stage  3  or  4  clinical  events,  severe  bacterial 
infections, malaria and hospitalization.  

Provision of antiretroviral treatment  
All  TB  patients  co-infected  with  HIV  should  be  given  antiretroviral  drugs.  Antiretroviral  therapy 
should be started immediately the diagnosis of HIV is  made in  a TB patient.  If the drugs  cannot  be 
obtained at the facility, the patient should be referred to a facility where they can obtain the drugs. 

2.8.4 Community Involvement in TB/HIV Activities 

Through  support  groups  for  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS,  village  health  teams  (VHTs)  and 
community-based  organizations,  TB  prevention  and  care  should  be  integrated  with  HIV/AIDS 
prevention, care and support. Communities should be effectively mobilized to advocate for resources 
and  opportunities  to  implement  collaborative  TB/HIV  activities.  Community-based  organizations, 
CB-DOTS  treatment  supporters  and  workplace  managers  or  staff  associations  should  also  be 
involved  in  identifying  people  with  symptoms  and  signs  of  TB  or  HIV/AIDS,  referring  them  to 
health  facilities  for  diagnosis  and  treatment  and  ensuring  directly  observed  treatment.  Innovative 
mechanisms for delivery of ART could be designed along these same lines.  

2.8.5 Monitoring and Evaluation of Collaborative TB/HIV Activities 
Monitoring and evaluation provide the means to assess quality, effectiveness of delivery and coverage 
of collaborative TB/HIV activities. Monitoring and evaluation involve collection and analysis of data 
for indicators of TB/HIV collaborative activities. These data are collected from the level of provision 
of service.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        68 

 
 
2.8.6 Presentation of TB in HIV infected persons 

EPTB  and  clinically  diagnosed  TB  commoner  among  HIV  +  than  HIV  –  persons.  Also,  the  more 
advanced  the  immunosuppression  the  more  TB  tends  towards  clinically  diagnosed,  EPTB  and 
disseminated forms.  

The  clinical  presentation  of  TB  in  early  HIV  infection  is  similar  to  that  in  HIV-negative  persons. 
However,  as  HIV  infection  progresses,  CD4+  T  lymphocytes  will  decline  in  number  and  function. 
These  cells  play  an  important  role  in  the  body’s  defense  against  tubercle  bacilli.  Thus,  the  immune 
system  becomes  less  able  to  prevent  growth  and  local  spread  of  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis. 
Disseminated and extra pulmonary TB diseases become more common. 

I. Pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients 

Even in HIV-infected patients, PTB is still the commonest form of TB. The presentation depends on 
the severity of immunosuppression. Table 2.8.2 below shows how the clinical picture, sputum result 
and chest x-ray appearance often differ in early and late HIV infection. You could copy a figure 55 
from UNION book “Epidemiologic Basis of Tuberculosis Control”. It demonstrates this better. 

Table 2.8.2: Comparison of pulmonary TB in early and late HIV infection among adolescents 
and adults

Late 

Clinical picture  

Often resembles post-primary PTB  Often resembles primary PTB 

Sputum smear result 

Often positive  

Often negative 

Chest X-ray appearance  Often cavities 

Often infiltrates with no cavities 

II. Extra pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients 
The  usual  forms  of  extra  pulmonary  TB;  pleural  effusion,  lymph  node,  pericarditis,  miliary, 
meningitis and disseminated TB (with myco-bacteremia) can occur in patients who are HIV positive. 
Occurrence of extra pulmonary TB (except TB lymph node only) implies severe HIV disease (WHO 
disease classification stage 4).  

2.8.7 Diagnosis of TB in HIV-Infected Patients 

Diagnosis  of  TB  among  people  infected  with  HIV  follows  the  same  principles  as  in  HIV  negative 
individuals.  There  are  however  some  differences  that  must  be  noted.  HIV  infected  persons  tend  to 
have smear negative TB, they have atypical radiological presentations of TB and they present more 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        69 

 
 
 
 
with disseminated TB. There are newer tests that have better accuracy in HIV infected persons such 
as Xpert MTB/Rif test. The NTLP TB diagnostic algorithm recommends that this test be used as the 
first test to diagnose TB among HIV infected persons. Another test called LAM is especially useful 
among HIV patients with low CD4 cell counts.  

2.8.8 TB Treatment in HIV-Infected Patients 

All patients diagnosed with TB, including those who are HIV infected should be treated with anti-TB 
drugs according to the NTLP recommendations. All patients on TB treatment should be supported to 
adhere and complete their medications under directly observed treatment (DOT).  

Antiretroviral  therapy  should  be  offered  to  all  HIV-positive  TB  patients,  according  to  the  National 
ART  and  care  guidelines  for  all  adults  and  children.  If  the  patient  is  not  on  ART  at  the  time  TB 
diagnosis  ART  should  be  initiated  within  8  weeks  of  starting  anti  tuberculosis  treatment.  It  is  a 
lifelong  treatment  requiring  a  high  adherence  rate  to  achieve  long-term  benefits  and  minimize  the 
development  of  drug  resistance.  Availability  of  antiretroviral  therapy  can  serve  as  an  incentive  for 
people to be tested for HIV.  

The table below gives guidance on when to start ART in a TB patient who is HIV infected. 

2.8.9 Common TB-ART Co-Treatment Regimens 

A  trained  staff  or  medical  officer  needs  to  decide  when  to  start  ART  and  the  ART  regimen.  For 
patients  being  considered  for,  or  already  on  TB-ART  co-treatment,  the  attending  health  worker 
should note the following:  

A patient on TB-ART co-treatment will have many tablets to swallow and may experience more side-
effects. Educate the patient on how to manage mild to moderate side-effects and report to the health 
worker immediately for severe ones. The patient continues receiving Cotrimoxazole. There are many 
tablets  and  several  changes  may  take  place  in  the  regimen  during  the  course  of  treatment.  This 
requires careful education of the patient and treatment supporter at each change. The TB treatment is 
not necessarily in the morning. 

The following examples are based on a Rifampicin-based regimen during the initial and continuation 
phases of TB treatment. The patient is put on an Efavirenz-based ART regimen if it is started during 
TB treatment.

Immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) 

Occasionally  a  patient’s  condition  becomes  worse  after  starting  antiretroviral  treatment.  The  patient 
develops  fever,  lymph  nodes  increase  in  size,  worsening  radiological  signs  and  increasing  pleural 
effusions.  This  is  called  immune  reconstitution  syndrome  (or  paradoxical  reaction).  However,  the 
diagnosis  should  only  be  made  after  thorough  investigations  have  excluded  other  causes  of  failure  to 
respond  to  treatment.  The  treatment  is  prednisolone  at  a  dose  of  1mg/kg  body  weight  for  two  weeks, 
then gradually reduced over another two weeks.  ART and anti-TB treatment should be continued.

2.9  TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION CONTROL 

Box 2.9.1: Highlights of the Uganda TB infection control guidelines 

Instituting  TB  Infection  Control  (TB  IC)  measures  is  recommended  to  minimize  TB  transmission  in 
congregate settings. To achieve this, four elements of TB IC are recommended: 

a)  Managerial measures - These measures constitute the basis for setting up TB IC and implementing them 

to ensure effective and smooth implementation of TB IC measures at a health facility level. 

b)  Administrative measures - This is the most important level, which attempts to stop/prevent the release of 
droplet  nuclei  into  the  air  thereby  reducing  the  exposure  of  the  HCWs,  patients  and  visitors  to  M. 
tuberculosis.  Ensures  that  all  patients  with  presumptive  TB  are  promptly  identified,  separated,  educated 
and started on effective TB treatment while minimizing stigma. 

a)  Environmental measures – Opening of windows and use of mechanical ventilation through use of fans 
reduces the concentration of droplet nuclei in the air in high risk areas and complements the administrative 
measures. 

b)  Personal  measures-  Wearing  of  N95  respirators  is  recommended  for  health  workers,  patient  attendants 
and  visitors  while  in  TB  facilities  or  attending  to  patients  with  or  suspected  to  have  DR-TB.  For  N95 
masks to be effective a fitting test is required. Face mask for patients. 

2.9.1 Introduction 

Pulmonary  Tuberculosis  is  an  airborne  disease  transmitted  when  a  patient  with  infectious 
pulmonary or Laryngeal TB coughs, sneezes, talks and sings. These situations release droplet nuclei 
in  the  air.  The  droplet  particles  that  are  approximately  <5  μm  quickly  dry  up  and  therefore  stay 
suspended in air for long and thus can circulate throughout a room or building while droplets that 
are >5 μm in diameter settle faster within about a meter of their source and therefore will not reach 
the alveoli where TB infection occurs. Large droplet particles ˃ 5 μm impact the nose, throat and 
large  airways  where  they  are  normally  ingested  by  macrophages  and  fail  to  cause  infection. 
Therefore, it’s the < 5 μm droplet nuclei that can be inhaled by a close contact (person living in the 
same household, or spending many hours a day together with the infectious TB patient in the same 
indoor living or working space) of this infectious TB patient thereby resulting into TB infection and 
subsequently  into  TB  disease.  The  TB  patients  who  are  most  likely  to  release  these  infectious 
droplet  nuclei are the ones who are pulmonary TB (PTB)  bacteriologically  confirmed  and not  on 
effective treatment, although infectious droplets may also be produced by PTB AFB sputum smear-
negative. Pulmonary TB patients are most likely to transmit tuberculosis when they are not yet on 
effective anti-TB treatment.   

Although  inhalation  of  infectious  droplet  nuclei  is  the  most  common  route  of  acquiring  TB 
infection,  infection  can  also  be  acquired  by  drinking  unpasteurized  milk  or  milk  products 
containing M. bovis (bovine TB, a different species).

2.9.2 Tuberculosis Infection Control (TB IC) measures 

TB  IC  is  a  combination  of  measures  and  work  practices  aimed  at  minimizing  the  risk  of  TB 
transmission  within  populations  or  congregate  setting.  TB  Infection  Control  measures  should 
complement general infection control efforts and airborne infection control efforts.   

The  Set  of  TB  infection  control  Measures  that  should  be  implemented  at  Health  facility  level  
 is outlined below: 

a)  Managerial activities at health facility level. 

To have effective and smooth implementation of TB IC measures at a health facility, there is need 
have  managerial  activities  in  place.  These  measures  constitute  the  basis  for  setting  up  and 
implementing the other controls at facility level. They thus ensure administrative commitment and 
leadership at facility level. These managerial activities include: 

  Identification or strengthening a TB IC coordinating team  
  Conduct of TB IC facility assessment to inform TB IC plans. The assessment should consider 
type  of  clinical  services  offered  by  the  facility  (e.g.  TB,  HIV,  general  services,  etc.),    the 
number  of  beds,  the  number  of  employees,  location  of  facility  and  the  different  clinics, 
disease  prevalence  in  the  community,  volume  of  patients  and  the  risks  of  exposure  to 
employees and patients prior to the creation of the action plan. 

  Development  of  a facility  specific TB  IC plan (based on the above assessment) that is  time 
bound with a budget (that includes human and material resources, policies and procedures that 
ensure  sustained  and  effective  implementation  of  the  TB  IC  measures  outlined  below.  The 
plan  should  cover  Radiology,  Sputum  induction  and  cough  inducing  procedures,  surgical 
autopsy suites, Intensive case areas and other high risk areas/ procedures. 

  Organization of TB IC at a facility level 
  Consideration  of  usage  of  available  space,  needed  renovation/remodeling  or  construction  to 

optimize implementation of TB IC  

  Conduction of onsite surveillance of TB among Health Care Workers (HCWs). HCWs are all 
people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health and these include only 
paid workers and cleaners working in a health facility. 

  Conduction  of  Advocacy,  Communication  and  Social  Mobilization  for  HCWs,  patients  and 

visitors. 

  Conduct of monitoring and evaluation of the set of TB IC measures at this facility 
  Participation in TB IC operational research 

2.9.3 Administrative TB-IC in General Health Facilities 

The staff in the general clinics should take the following steps to ensure infection control:

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

vi) 

Develop  a “triage” system  whereby  known  TB  patients  or persons likely  to  be presumptive 
TB  patients  and  their  accompanying  contacts  are  promptly  identified,  isolated  in  a  well-
ventilated  place  upon  arrival  at  a  health  facility  clinic  and  are  fast  tracked  to  diagnosis  and 
treatment follow up. Fast tracking of these patients, reduces the time they spend in  a health 
facility  thereby  minimizing  TB  transmission.  The  health  workers  do  this  by  asking  the 
patients  questions  such  as:  Who  among  you  has  a  cough  that  has  lasted  for  two  or  more 
weeks? Is there anyone among you who has ever been treated for TB? To minimize stigma, 
explain  to  patients  that  safety  without  stigma  is  the  goal  of  IC  and  that  screening  for,  and 
prevention of TB transmission is part of providing quality health care. 
Educate patients about cough hygiene: When you cough, cover your mouth and nose  with a 
handkerchief  or  paper  tissue.  If  you  do  not  have  a  handkerchief  or  paper  tissue,  turn  to  the 
inside  of  your  arm,  and  cover  your  nose  and  mouth  with  it  (See  Figure  2.6).  This  figure 
should  hang  on  the  wall  in  the  clinic.  If  a  face  mask  is  available,  give  to  known  or 
presumptive TB patients to wear over their mouth and nose. 
Even if the mouth is covered, tell the patients always to turn away from facing other people 
when coughing, whether the mouth is covered by a handkerchief, tissue, face mask or an arm. 
Identify  an  area  of  the  ward  or  isolation  room  that  is  separated  from  the  main  ward  and 
designate it for diagnosed and presumptive TB patients. This area should be a well-ventilated 
area of the ward. 
Develop written instructions on keeping windows and doors open for ample circulation of air. 
This  instruction  should  clearly  indicate  time  to  open  windows  and  doors,  and  the  patients 
should be informed about this when first admitted and constantly reminded about it. 
Transport  known  and  presumptive  TB  patients  with  window  open  or  patients  seated  in  a 
separate cabin 

vii)  Designate TB IC responsibilities clearly and correctly and at same time communicate with all 

relevant partners and stakeholders. 

2.9.4 Administrative TB-IC Measures in Tuberculosis clinics and wards 

The staff in the TB clinics should: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

Regularly educate TB patients about the importance of preventing transmission of TB in the 
wards and at all outpatient clinics. 
Ask  the  patients  to  identify  anyone  with  two  or  more  weeks  of  cough  in  their  family  or 
community so that they can be examined for TB disease. 
Educate the patients  about  cough hygiene.  Instruct  patients  to  cover their mouths and noses 
with a handkerchief (Figure 2.9.1).  This is to prevent further transmission between patients, 
attendants and staff. Explain to them that this is for the benefit of everybody and should not 
make them feel bad or discriminated against. 
 Sputum produced after  coughing should be placed in  a  screw capped  container, disinfected 
after use and place in a highly infectious waste bin before final disposal. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        74 

 
 
v) 

Identify  known  or  suspected  drug-resistant  TB  patients  and  separate  them  from  other  TB 
patients. 
Develop and hang health education messages on the ward and clinic walls. 

vi) 
vii)  Develop  written  instructions  on  keeping  windows  and  doors  open  for  free  circulation.  This 
instruction should clearly indicate time to open windows and doors, and inpatients should be 
informed about this when they are first admitted and constantly reminded about it. 

ix) 

viii)  All  staff  should  periodically  be  screened  for  symptoms  of  active  TB  disease.  Schedule  TB 
testing  for  all  staff  at  least  once  a  year  using  Xpert  MTB/Rif  for  those  symptomatic  and  or 
CXR. 
Offer  staff  voluntary,  confidential  HIV  counseling/testing,  and  annual  repeat  testing  if  HIV 
negative on previous occasions.  
Document  both  TB  and  HIV  results  in  staff  member’s  occupational  file.  HIV  positive  staff 
should be offered  Anti-retroviral  therapy and  Isoniazid preventive therapy  (IPT) and should 
not  be deployed high-prevalent TB settings.  Offer HIV preventive services to  HIV negative 
health care workers.

2.9.5 Environmental Controls at facility level 

The objective of environmental control measures is to ensure sufficient air exchange and to control 
direction of airflow to reduce the risk of TB exposure.  Sufficient air exchange of about ≥ 8-12 air 
changes per hour (ACH) reduces the concentration of droplet nuclei in the room air.  

The  forms  of  environmental  control  measures  include;  Ventilation  (Natural  ventilation    like 
opening  of  windows  and  Mechanical  Ventilation  through  use  of  fans  –  ceiling,  floor  and  wall 
exhaust fans which  force air exchanges and to drive air flow by generating negative pressure in the 
room thereby driving bad air out and  fresh air in), Mixed-mode Ventilation (uses both mechanical 
and natural ventilation), HEPA filtration, Air flow by negative pressure mechanism and Ultraviolet 
Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI).  

They  all  have  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  therefore,  the  choice  of  any  of  the  above 
environmental  measures  is  based  of  available  technology,  building  design,  local  climatic  factors, 
specialty of the health facility and technical capacity to install these devices as well as resources to 
procure  and  maintain  them.  In  our  settings  and  in  most  health  care  facilities,  use  of  natural 
ventilation that achieves ≥ 8-12 air changes per hour (ACH) is adequate and cost effective. 

Natural  air  movement  should  be  monitored  to  determine  the  sitting  arrangement  in  consultation 
rooms between patients and HCWs as illustrated in figure 2.7 below. 

Figure 2.9.2: Clinic sitting arrangement 

In  addition  to  paying  attention  to  sitting  arrangement  to  reduce  the  risk  of  exposure,  the  inter-bed 
distances  in  TB  risk  areas  like  TB  wards  and  medical  wards  etc.  have  to  be  kept  at  2.5  meters 
(measured from the center of one bed to the center of the next bed to prevent overcrowding thereby 
allowing improved air circulation within facility wards. The bed arrangement should be with head-to-
foot,  instead  of  head-to-head  (Figure  2.9.3).  Furniture  should  be  positioned  in  a  way  that  does  not 
interfere with the free flow of fresh air within a clinic or facility ward.

2.9.6 Personal TB-IC Measures for Health Workers 

In order to control TB infection among health care workers, they should: 

i) 

ii) 

Learn the symptoms of presumptive TB. Should any health worker have a cough that lasts for 
2  or  more  weeks  that  is  associated  with  fevers,  loss  of  weight  and  reduced  appetite,  such  a 
health worker should report for examination to diagnose TB. 
Be encouraged to know their HIV status and, if positive, must not be assigned to work in TB 
wards or clinics. 

iii)  Whenever possible, health workers should be examined to exclude TB twice a year. 
iv) 

Use personal protection exposures (PPE) such as N95 mask whenever possible during work 
within  TB  wards  or  clinics.  Wearing  of  N95  respirators  is  a  must  while  working  in  drug 
resistant  TB  (DR-TB)  facilities  or  attending  to  patients  with  or  suspected  to  have  DR-TB. 
Those working in areas such as x-ray rooms and the mortuary should be prioritized for N95 
masks. For N95 masks to be effective a fitting test is required. 

2.9.7 Disinfection and Disposal of Sputum 

i) 

Health  workers  must  ensure  that,  after  instructing  the  patients  how  to  obtain  a  sputum 
specimen,  the  patient  goes  to  perform  the  act  of  producing  the  specimen  in  an  open  place 
away  from  the  laboratory  and  other  people.  When  a  designated  area  for  taking  sputum, 
specimen is available, the patient is sent to the area. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        77 

 
 
 
ii) 

Sputum  of  inpatients  that  is  collected  for  disposal  should  be  in  a  sputum  mug  or  a  plastic 
screw cap container. This container should have disinfectant liquid (5% Lysol) poured into it 
before  the  sputum  material  is  put  in  it.  Sputum  from  all  the  inpatients  wards  should  be 
collected  into  one  big  container,  further  disinfected,  and  then  disposed  of  according  to 
standard guidelines for disposal of biological waste. 

2.9.8 TB-IC in Congregated Populations 

A  congregated  population  is  a  group  of  people  staying  close  in  proximity  to  each  other  –  for 
example,  school  children,  refugees,  soldiers  and  prisoners.  The  measures  described  below  are 
useful for controlling TB infection in such a population:  
i) 

Plan  for  and  develop  TB  and  HIV/AIDS  collaborative  activities  for  the  institution  with  a 
congregated population. 
Establish TB diagnostic and treatment services. 
Educate  population  and  staff  on  relationship  between  TB  and  HIV  infection,  so  that  they 
can recognize TB suspects. 
Advocate for an isolation unit for patients diagnosed with TB or suspected to have TB. 
Consider  “active  screening”  of  the  immediate  group  members  for  TB,  when  a  new 
pulmonary TB sputum smear-positive is diagnosed. 

ii) 
iii) 

iv) 
v) 

2.9.9 TB-IC in Households 

TB-IC  activities  and  measures  used  in  health  care  facilities  also  apply  to  households  (HHs).  All 
stakeholders must be involved. Policy makers, community leaders, patients and their families have to 
appreciate  the  importance  of  TB-IC  in  HHs.  TB-IC  in  households  begins  with  ensuring  early 
diagnosis of TB. Patients and their family members are the first to notice TB symptoms. They should 
immediate ensure that care is sought. Once a diagnosis is made, adherence to treatment is key to TB-
IC.    Furthermore,  practices  to  reduce  the  spread  of  TB  should  be  implemented.  These  practices 
include:  

  Houses should be adequately ventilated, particularly rooms where people with infectious TB 
spend  considerable  time  (natural  ventilation  may  be  sufficient  to  provide  adequate 
ventilation). 

  Anyone who coughs should be educated on cough etiquette and should follow such practices 

always. 

  While  smear  positive,  TB  patients  should  spend  as  much  time  as  possible  outdoors,  sleep 
alone in a separate, adequately ventilated room and spend as little time as possible in public 
places or in public transport. 

  While smear or culture positive, MDR-TB patients who cough should always practice cough 

etiquette (including use of face masks) when in contact with people. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        78 

 
 
 

 

Ideally, health service providers should wear respirators when attending patients in enclosed 
spaces. 
Ideally, family members living with HIV, or family members with strong clinical evidence of 
HIV  infection,  should  not  provide  care  for  infectious  MDR-TB  patients.  If  there  is  no 
alternative, HIV positive family members should wear respirators. 

  Children  below  five  years  of  age  should  spend  as  little  time  as  possible  in  the  same  living 
spaces as  culture-positive MDR-TB patients. Such children should be followed up regularly 
with TB screening for two years and, if positive, drug-susceptibility testing must be done. 
  When  conditions  do  not  exist  to  minimize  risk  of  TB  infection  in  a  household,  XDR-TB 

patients should be admitted to a specialized healthcare facility. 

  Household  members  of  any  TB  patients  should be  encouraged  to  get  screened  for  HIV  and 

 

 

TB and be given appropriate (preventive) therapy. 
If possible, HIV-positive family members, or family members with a strong clinical evidence 
of HIV infection, should not share a household with culture positive XDR-TB patients. 
If  possible,  renovation  of  the  patient’s  home  should  be  considered,  to  improve  ventilation 
(e.g. building of a separate bedroom, or installation of a window or wind catcher  – “Whirly 
bird”– or both).1 

2.9.10 Hierarchy of Infection control measures 

Infection  control  measures  can  also  be  looked  at  as  being  in  a  form  of  hierarchy.  This  hierarchy 
highlights the relative importance of infection control measures. The hierarchy is: 

a)  1st priority: Administrative controls (workplace)  

This is the most important level, which aims to stop/prevent the release of droplet nuclei into 
the air thereby reducing the exposure of the HCWs, patients and visitors to M. tuberculosis. 

b)  2nd priority: Environmental Engineering) controls  

These  actions  complement  the  administrative  measures.  They  reduce  the  concentration  of 
droplet nuclei in the air in high risk areas. 
c)  3rd priority: Personal protective measures  

These  measures  protect  individual  persons  especially  HCWs  from  releasing  or  inhaling  the 
droplet nuclei.

2.10 TUBERCULOSIS LABORATORY SERVICES  

2.10.1 Diagnostic Methods 
The  End  TB  Strategy  calls  for  the  early  diagnosis  of  TB  and  universal  drug  susceptibility  testing 
(DST), highlighting the critical role of laboratories for rapidly and accurately detecting TB and drug 
resistance. Laboratory confirmation of TB and drug resistance is essential to ensure that individuals 
with TB are correctly diagnosed and have access to the appropriate treatment as soon as possible. All 
presumptive  TB  patients  should  be  examined  per  the  standardized  procedures  and  national 
algorithms. In Uganda, the commonly used diagnostic tests used to confirm/exclude TB are: 

  Microscopy 
  Xpert MTB/Rif test  
  Culture 
  Histopathology  

2.10.2 Microscopic Examination of Sputum Smears 
Although newer genotypic TB testing methods such as Xpert MTB/Rif have now been rolled out in 
most clinics in  the country, sputum  microscopy is still  the most widely used method of identifying 
patients  with  infectious  forms  of  pulmonary  TB.  Microscopy  is  easy  to  perform  at  the  peripheral 
laboratories, cheap and accurate. It can be used for diagnosis, monitoring response to treatment and 
defining  cure.  It  is  a  key  tool  for  case  detection  and  monitoring.  The  light  microscope  and  Ziehl–
Neelsen staining (and its modifications) have been in use for more than a century. Light microscopy 
has a good specificity but variable and low sensitivity which is worse in HIV‐ infected TB patients. 
To  improve  sensitivity  of  light  microscopy,  concentration  methods  have  been  developed. 
Concentration  methods  improve  ZN  yield  by  13%  and  should  be  encouraged  where  appropriate.  
However, this approach can only be performed at relatively well equipped laboratories; where there 
is electricity and centrifuge‐  limiting its usefulness in peripheral clinics where the need is highest.  

Fluorescent Microscopy (FM) is an improvement on the light microscope. FM has been demonstrated 
to be superior to light microscopy (ZN). In the developed world, this has virtually replaced the light 
microscope. However, the cost and need for electricity has led to limited application of fluorescent 
microscopy.  Because  of  this  the  Foundation  for  Innovation  of  New  Diagnostics  (FIND)  has  been 
supporting the developments of newer diagnostics for TB. It has supported the development of a new 
fluorescent microscopy using Light Emitting Diodes (LED) which can use ordinary batteries and do 
not  need  the  use  of  a  dark  room  (WHO,  2010).  The  LED  has  a  sensitivity  comparable  to  that  of 
standard  FM  and  it  is  also  cheaper.  This  technology  has  been  rolled  out  in  Uganda.  Sputum 
microscopy  is  kept  reliable  if  laboratories  participate  in  external  quality  assurance  (EQA)  such  as 
blinded rechecking.  In blinded  rechecking, randomly selected slides  examined at  the laboratory  are 
re-examined at another laboratory usually a higher-level laboratory. However, one S+ is sufficient to 
clinch a diagnosis of TB, provided the DTU is EQA certified. A maximum of two sputum specimens 
should be collected and examined on two consecutive days (spot and early morning).

The  laboratory  should  keep  all  positive  and  negative  slides  in  the  same  slide  box  in  sequence  to 
facilitate quality assurance procedures. The sputum  specimen collection procedures are provided  in 
the annex.  

2.10.3a Xpert MTB/ RIF test (GeneXpert) 

Xpert MTB/Rif is a new molecular test that has been designed to test for a part of the TB DNA that is 
highly  specific  for  MTB.  This  part  is  biologically  referred  to  as  IS6110.  The  test  also  tests  for  a 
mutation that confers to the MTB organism resistance to the most effective TB drug, Rifampicin. The 
mutation occurs in the rpoB gene. Xpert MTB/Rif is an automated test that can be used in peripheral 
laboratories directly on sputum samples as they are collected from patients to test for the IS6110 and 
rpoB gene. When the test is done on fresh sputum it called direct Xpert MTB/Rif. The test requires 
minimal sample processing and returns a result within 4 hours.  Xpert MTB/Rif is recommended as 
the first test for all presumptive TB patients

2.10.3b Line probe assay (LPA) 

The  LPA  test  is  another  molecular  test  that  tests  for  mutations  that  confers  to  the  MTB  organism 
Rifampicin  resistance  as  well  as  H  resistance  hence  allowing  a  full  diagnosis  of  MDR  TB.  It  is 
recommended for patients in whom a rapid confirmation of MDR status is needed.  
One spot sputum specimen should be collected for smear microscopy, if AFB positive then another 
specimen  must  be  collected  for  LPA.  If  smear  microscopy  is  AFB  negative,  another  sample  for 
culture  and  LPA  must  be  collected.  Like  Xpert  MTB/Rif,  LPA  returns  the  following  results:  MTB 
detected or MTB not detected. MTB not detected does not completely rule out TB. Then it returns 
MTB detected, Rifampicin and H susceptible. It can also return the result MTB detected, Rifampicin 
resistant and H susceptible. This result, does not completely rule out MDR TB because the gene test 
for H resistance is not as perfected as the Rifampicin resistance test. MTB detected Rifampicin and H 
resistant means the patient has MDR TB. MTB detected INH resistant; Rifampicin susceptible is also 
a possible test result. This result means that the patient has H mono resistance. 

2.10.4 Culture 

The  probability  of  finding  AFB  in  sputum  specimens  by  smear  microscopy  or  molecular  tests  is 
directly  related  to  the  concentration  of  bacilli  in  the  sputum.  In  comparison,  mycobacterial  culture 
can detect  far lower numbers of TB bacilli. Moreover, the culture makes it possible to  identify the 
mycobacterial species based on biochemical and other properties.  

Culture  of  M.  tb  bacilli  is  very  sensitive  and  specific,  but  is  expensive,  as  it  is  a  complex  and 
sophisticated procedure. It  requires a specialized laboratory set-up, and culture results are available 
only  after  6  to  8  weeks.  Culture  with  DST  takes  even  longer.  If  available,  culture  can  be  used  for 
diagnosis or confirmation of the diagnosis  of TB  in  patients  with PTB and  EPTB. Since it is more 
sensitive than smear, culture may also have a role in the diagnosis of smear-negative, HIV-positive 
TB suspects who are likely to be paucibacillary. 

In addition to its use in surveillance, culture with DST is valuable for diagnosis and management of 
drug-resistant TB. It is mainly used to screen patients who have a poor response to correct treatment, 
as well as those that have been previously treated – a group of patients likely to have drug-resistant 
TB.

2.10.6 Network of TB laboratory services in Uganda  

Microscopy  sites:  Health  facilities  with  laboratories  performing  TB  microscopy,  referred  to  as 
diagnostic TB units (DTU), in Uganda have increased from 303 in 2006 to about 1,336 by the end of 
2015. At parish level, there are only 85 HCII DTU because the national health policy targets HCIII 
and above for laboratories, 953 DTU HC III at sub-county level, 163 DTU HCIV at county level and 
133  DTU  hospitals  that  include  the  2  National  Referral  Hospitals,  17  Regional  referral  (13 
government  of  Uganda  (GoU)  and  4  PNFP)  and  9  private  hospitals.  The  rest  of  the  hospitals  are 
General hospitals (64 GoU and 52 PNFP). 

Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT): Genotypic methods have considerable advantages when 
the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB is  being scaled up, in particular with  regard  to 
their speed, the standardization of testing, their potentially high output and the reduced requirements 
for biosafety. The most commonly used NAAT in Uganda is  the Xpert  MTB/RIF. The  Line Probe 
Assay (LPA) at the National TB Reference Laboratory is mainly for research purposes. 

As of 2016, the country installed 111 Xpert MTB/Rif machines in 105 sites/health facilities through 
the  support  of  Government  and  its  partners,  that  is  in  87  public  facilities  and  these  are  Mulago 
National Referral Hospital, 13 Regional referral hospitals, 43 general hospitals, 21 HC IV, six HC III, 
one HC II and the NTRL, 13 PNFP i.e. 10 hospitals and three HIV care facilities, two private clinics 
and three research institutions. 

Culture and Drug susceptibility testing: WHO and other international technical agencies advocate- 
one  TB  culture  laboratory  for  every  5  million  population,  and  one  DST  laboratory  for  every  10 
million population supporting the TB control program. Thus, Uganda with approximately 35 million 
populations,  would  be  requiring  seven  culture  laboratories  as  well  as  four  DST  laboratories  at  the 
minimum. As of date, nine TB culture laboratories are functional in the country, in both public and 
NGO/Private sector.  

National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) 

The National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) is under the NTLP central Unit. The mission of the 
NTRL is to provide quality laboratory services and to strengthen the national tuberculosis laboratory 
diagnostic  network  through  leadership  and  expert  guidance  in  support  of  the  NTLP  to  reduce  the 
burden  of  tuberculosis  and  leprosy  in  Uganda.  NTRL  provides  referral  laboratory  services  for  TB 
diagnosis, surveillance and monitoring through laboratory testing and provision of professional and 
technical advice. The NTRL is not yet providing similar services for leprosy.  

In 2013, the NTRL  received international accreditation under the ISO 15189 and was elevated to a 
Supra-national  TB  Reference  Laboratory  (SRL),  the  second  SRL  in  the  WHO  AFRO  region. 
Through the SRL status, the NTRL supports over 18 countries in East and Central Africa.

System for sample transport and transmission of results  

The  country  has  established  a  hub  network  for  sample  referral  to  diagnostic  laboratories  and 
returning  results  to  referring  health  facilities.  Each  hub  has  a  motorcycle  rider  who  transports 
samples and results to and from the DTUs. Samples from RR patients are referred to NTRL through 
Posta Uganda.  

The country currently has 100 hubs in the lab network and has strategically placed Xpert MTB/RIF 
in 62% of the hubs (Annex 11). The country has plans to cover all the hubs with Xpert MTB/RIF 
and  implement  online  monitoring  tools  such  as  GxAlert  and  Xpert  MTB/RIF  Laboratory 
Information  Management  System  (GxLIMS)  to  help  in  real-time  transmission  of  results  to  the 
health facilities. 

2.10.7 External Quality Assessment (EQA) 

To  be  reliable,  laboratories  performing  microscopy,  culture  and  molecular  tests  must  participate  in 
external  quality  assurance  (EQA)  programs.  The  process  involves  the  examination  of  previously 
prepared slides to see if: 

  Slides were prepared properly 
  Slides were examined, and the reported results (positive or negative) are correct 
  Recommended laboratory procedures are followed 
  Safety measures are adhered to

2.11 TB MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

2.11.1 Introduction 

What is monitoring? 

Monitoring  is  continuous  process  of  data  collection  to  track  how  a  program/activity  is  being 
implemented  in  relation  to  activity  plan.  Routine  tracking  of  the  key  elements  of  program/project 
performance,  usually  inputs  and  outputs  is  achieved  through  record  keeping,  regular  reporting  and 
surveillance systems. Therefore, monitoring is useful to:  

  Track progress toward the set performance standards (targets) 
  Determine whether activities are proceeding according to plan or need adjustment during the 

intervention or implementation is order to realize desired outputs or outcomes 

What is evaluation? 

Evaluation  is  the  systematic  assessment  of  an  on-going  or  completed  service,  project,  program  or 
policy,  involving  its  design,  implementation  and  results  to  determine  its  worth  or  merit;  determine 
how  well  the  project  or  program  has  met  set  objectives  and/or  the  extent  to  which  changes  in 
outcomes can be attributed to the interventions, project or program.  

Impact  evaluation  is  the  process  of  measuring  of  how  much  things  have  changed  because  of  the 
intervention(s)  implemented.  Because  there  are  many  factors  that  cause  things  to  change,  a  formal 
evaluation tries to demonstrate how much a specific intervention contributed to the change. 

2.11.2 Importance of monitoring & evaluation  

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plays an important role in the management of the TB program at 
all levels. It is important for National TB programs to follow epidemiological trends in TB, identify 
strengths  and weaknesses in  program  design or implementation and informs  program  priorities and 
advocacy  among  policy  makers.  M&E  ensures  that  the  resources  going  into  the  program  including 
human and financial resources  are being  efficiently  utilized;  services are  being  optimally  accessed; 
activities are occurring in a sustainable timely manner; and expected results are being achieved.

It has elements of data collection, reporting, analysis and supervision 
It is systematically done  
It promotes data demand and information use 
It  generates  data  that  informs  policy  decisions,  design  and  implementation  of  TB  control 
activities by the National TB program. 
It  works  in  an  established  framework  for  tracking  progress  and  demonstrating  Program 
results. 
It  is  based  on  indicators  that  measure  changes  in  service  delivery  for  instance,  TB  case 
detection, treatment outcomes, etc. as outlined in the NTLP national strategic plan 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        86 

 
 
 
The NTLP has  developed a  monitoring and  evaluation  (M&E) plan to  measure  the performance of 
NTLP strategic plan. The M&E plan uses the following monitoring framework to track progress of 
TB control in Uganda and implementation of the National Strategic Plan. It can be seen from figure 
2.11.1  that  TB  indicators  can  be  derived  from  inputs,  processes  and  outputs.  Furthermore,  more 
indicators are derived from outcomes and impacts. Altogether these form the backbone of indicators 
that are used to measure the performance of the NTLP. 

Figure 2.11.1: Framework for TB indicator and monitoring 

2.11.4 Data reporting system 

The routine reporting system is from Diagnostic and Treatment Unit (DTU) to district, from district 
to  the  central  NTLP  office.  Standard  operating  procedures  (SOPs)  have  been  developed  to  guide 
health  facility,  district,  regional  and  national  level  officers  in  data  completeness,  quality  and 
utilization for performance improvement at different levels. 

TB service data is currently reported through two systems; 

  By facilities through HMIS to the MOH/Resource center.  
  By  the  district,  TB  and  leprosy  supervisors  (DTLS)  through  the  Regional  TB  and  Leprosy 

focal persons, to the NTLP using the TB quarterly report form.  

2.11.5 TB monitoring tools. 

Monitoring requires that there should be “monitoring tools.” The NTLP uses the following forms 
and registers as tools to monitor program activities.

LEPROSY 

3.1 GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT LEPROSY 

  Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease. 
 
It has a very long incubation period. 
 
Its different clinical manifestations are determined by the level of immunological defense of 
the body. 
It affects people of all races, ages and sexes. 

 
  The main sources of infection are untreated patients with the infectious forms of the 

diseasen 

3.1.1 Definition of Leprosy 

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that affects the skin, peripheral 
nerves and the mucous membranes. The disease affects people of all races and ages and both sexes. 
In  this  context,  a  case  of  leprosy  is  a  person  with  clinical  signs  of  leprosy  who  requires  chemotherapy 
(MDT); this excludes people with residual signs of leprosy after completion of a full course of treatment. 

3.1.2 Source of Infection and Mode of Transmission 

The mode of transmission is uncertain, but it is believed that M. leprae is spread from person to person 
primarily as nasal droplet infection. Untreated leprosy patients discharging bacilli are considered the main 
source of infection. Persons living in the same household or who otherwise are in frequent contact with an 
infectious person have the greatest risk of being exposed to the bacilli. 

The incubation period is usually long, ranging from 3 to 5 years but it may vary from 6 months to more 
than 20 years. The peak age of onset is young adulthood, usually 20 to 30 years of age. Whereas there are 
published reports of people co-infected with leprosy and HIV, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting 
an association between HIV infection and leprosy. 

3.1.3 Natural History  

While  most  individuals  exposed  to  an  infectious  case  of  leprosy  become  infected,  only  a  very  small 
proportion (less than 5 percent) of those infected develop the disease.  In the majority of cases, specific 
immunological defences kill the bacilli. 
The  different  manifestations  of  leprosy  (multibacillary  and  paucibacillary)  are  due  to  differences  in  the 
degree of immunological defence of the human body and not due to different kinds of bacilli. Individuals 
with a partially impaired immunity have a higher chance to develop paucibacillary leprosy (the form with 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        104 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
few  bacilli)  while  those  with  a  low  natural  immunity  to  M.  leprae  a  higher  chance  to  develop 
multibacillary disease. 
Patients carrying many leprosy bacilli are called multibacillary. They are considered the main source of 
infection.   
Untreated multibacillary leprosy patients continue spreading the infection. When left untreated, 
 leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves and eyes.   

3.2 CASE FINDING AND DIAGNOSIS OF LEPROSY 

  Early diagnosis and prompt treatment reduces disabilities due to leprosy and stops transmission  

to others. 

  Early detection of new patients is a joint effort of communities and health service providers 
  Persons with suspect signs should be referred to the nearest diagnostic facility 
  Diagnosis of leprosy must be based on careful clinical examination 
  Leprosy is diagnosed after finding at least one of the three cardinal signs. 
  Leprosy patients are classified into PB and MB for purposes of determining the treatment 

regimen 

  Newly diagnosed patients should receive sufficient explanation to ensure prompt and proper  
       treatment 
3.2.1 Case definition 

 A case of leprosy is a person with clinical signs of leprosy who requires chemotherapy.  
The clinical signs which are referred to as the “cardinal signs” of leprosy are:  

 

i)   Hypopigmented patches with definite loss of sensation in them                                    
ii)  Thickened or enlarged peripheral nerves at sites where nerves are often affected with loss of 
sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by those nerves 
iii) The presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit skin smear 

3.2.2 Case-finding 

The NTLP aims at early diagnosis of most cases occurring in the community by: 
  Training health workers to recognize symptoms and signs of the disease 
  Providing health education to communities aimed at increasing awareness of the disease 
  Engaging Village Health Teams in leprosy case finding initiatives. 
  Delivering good treatment services to known leprosy patients, so that other persons with suspect signs 
and  symptoms  may  also  have  confidence  in  the  good  treatment  and  thus  come  forward  to  be 
examined and treated (self-reporting) 

  Establishing a clear referral system to deal with difficult diagnoses 
  Proper  examination  of  all  persons  presenting  themselves  at  health  facilities  with  different  skin 

conditions 

  Carrying out systematic examination of house-hold contacts of all newly detected leprosy cases. 

3.2.2.1 When to suspect leprosy 
Leprosy should be suspected in people with any of the following symptoms and signs: 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        105 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Pale or reddish patches on the skin (the most common sign of leprosy) 
  Loss or decrease of feeling in the skin patch 
  Numbness or tingling of the hands or feet 
  Weakness of the hands, feet or eyelids 
  Painful or tender nerves 
  Swellings or lumps in the face or earlobes; and 
  Painless wounds or burns on the hands or feet 

If one is not sure of the diagnosis, the patient with suspect signs and symptoms should be referred to the 
next level.  Such a person should not be registered as a case of leprosy. 

3.2.3 How leprosy is diagnosed 
Diagnosis of leprosy must be based on careful clinical examination of the patient and, when necessary, 
backed  by  bacteriological  examination.  Leprosy  is  diagnosed  when  at  least  one  of  the  following 
cardinal signs is present:  

i)   Hypopigmented patches with definite loss of sensation in them                                        
ii)    Thickened  or  enlarged  peripheral  nerves  at  sites  where  nerves  are  often  affected  (see 
diagram) with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by those nerves 
iii) The presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit skin smear 
A patient not having at least one of those signs should not be registered as a case of leprosy 

3.2.3.1 Diagnostic and treatment units for leprosy 
One or more health facilities in every district will be designated as a diagnostic and treatment unit for 
leprosy. The number of such units will be determined according to the level of endemicity of leprosy in 
the district. 
Staff at  diagnostic units will be expected to  diagnose, register and treat  leprosy patients  as described in 
3.2.2.4 below. 

the  District  TB/Leprosy  Supervisor  (DTLS)  or  appropriate  staff  of 

At undesignated facilities, specific treatment must be given only after the diagnosis has been confirmed 
leprosy 
by 
diagnostic/treatment center. If the DTLS in not expected to visit the facility soon, the patient should be 
referred to the unit where the DTLS is based or to the nearest leprosy diagnostic and treatment unit.

3.2.3.2 Responsibilities of health workers in leprosy diagnostic and treatment units 

The health workers at the diagnostic and treatment unit for leprosy are expected to: 

  Carry out a complete physical examination (according to guidelines outlined in this manual) 
  Confirm the diagnosis of leprosy  
  Explain  to  the  patient  what  the  disease  is,  what  might  be  expected  of  treatment  and  possible 

complications  

  Prescribe  the  appropriate  treatment  and  inform  the  patient  where  and  when  the  treatment  can  be 

accessed. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        106 

 
 
  Enter  the  patient’s  particulars  in  the  Unit  Leprosy  Register.  The  unit  in-charge  should  notify  the 

patients through the HMIS 

  Write out  the patient’s Clinic Appointment Card  
  Carry out systematic assessment of the close contacts of the newly detected patient within the first one 

month of establishing the diagnosis. 

3.2.3.3 Leprosy related responsibilities of the DTLS on visiting a health unit                                                   

The DTLS or other designated Focal Person on visiting a health facility does the following: 
  Carries  out  complete  physical  examination  on  known  leprosy  patients  and  those  with  suspect 

symptoms and signs 

  Validates  the  information  recorded  by  the  health  facility  staff  on  the  Leprosy  Record  Card  and  the 

Unit Leprosy Register 

  Organises the taking of skin smears 
  Explains to the patient about the disease and its treatment 
  Enters patient data in the District Leprosy Register 
  Enter the District Registration number in the Unit Leprosy Register, Leprosy Record Card 

3.2.3.4 Clinical examination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Information that must be asked for and recorded on the Leprosy Record Card:                

  General information on the patient: complete name, sex, place, date of birth, full address (village. 
Parish and sub-county), mobile telephone number, distance from home to health unit, occupation 
 Contact  information:  Other  people  in  the  same  household  and  family  (including  children)  and 
indicating if any of them were ever diagnosed or treated for leprosy.  

 

History taking 

  Main complaints: date of onset, sites of the lesions, subsequent changes  and development of the 

disease, treatment received 

Physical examination 
It is recommended that the physical examination be carried out with:  

  adequate light (preferably daylight) available, because it is difficult to see the lesions in poor light  
  enough privacy for the person to feel at ease 

To ensure that no important sign is missed, the clinical examination should include the entire skin surface, 
back and front, in the following sequence: 

  Head and neck 
  Front of chest and abdomen 
  Arms 
  Back of chest and buttocks  
  External genitalia in male patients 
  Legs

I.   Examination of the skin 
The skin should be examined for: 

  Presence of skin lesions (patches or nodules) 
  Number of skin lesions 
  Loss of sensation on the skin lesions (patches) 

 Instructions for sensory testing 

Test the sensation of skin lesions with a wisp of cotton wool as follows: 

  Roll the end of a wisp of cotton wool into a fine point. 
  Explain to patients the purpose of the test and what is expected of them. 
  After the explanation, conduct a trial test by touching the patients on normal skin with 
their eyes open so that they can exactly see what is done. Continue until they show that 
they understand the purpose of the test. 

  Then do the testing with the patients’ eyes closed. First test on normal skin. When they 

point correctly, test in the skin patches while touching normal skin now and then. Watch 
at every touch that the patients keep their eyes closed. 

  Touch the skin with this point so that the cotton wool bends. 
  Patients should be asked to indicate accurately with the tip of a finger, every spot you 

have touched with the cotton wool.* 

  Failure of the patient to indicate tested areas accurately implies loss of sensation.  

*Sometimes  patients  point  accurately  to  areas  of  normal  skin  but  point  more  than  2  cm  away  from 
where  the  skin  patch  is  tested.  This  is  called  mis-reference,  and  shows  diminished  sensation  in  the 
patch. If this is consistent during repeated testing of a patch, it is a cardinal sign and thus diagnosis of 
leprosy is made. For thickened skin areas such as the palms and soles use the tip of a ballpoint pen for 
testing sensation.

II. Examination of peripheral nerves 
The peripheral nerves are examined for: 

  Size (enlargement or thickening) 
  Tenderness (pain on palpation) 
  Nerve function assessment 

Figure 3.1 Names of superficial nerve trunks and sites where they can be palpated 

How to palpate nerves for size and tenderness 

  To assess the thickness of a nerve, compare the size of your nerve to that of the patient 
  Always compare the patient’s left side with the right side nerve(s). 
  Palpate the nerve with 2 or 3 fingers by rolling the nerve on the surface of the underlying bone 
and  determine  the  thickness  and  tenderness  (pain  on  pressure)  at  the  sites  indicated  in  Fig  3.1 
above. 

  Finding  thick  nerves,  especially  in  combination  with  other  signs  and  symptoms  of  leprosy,  is 

diagnostic of leprosy. 

How to carry out nerve function assessment 
Peripheral nerve trunks carry 3 types of nerve fibers – autonomic, sensory and motor. It is recommended 
to  assess  each  nerve  function  separately.  Any  loss  of  function  will  indicate  possible  damage  to  the 
relevant nerve fibers. 

  Autonomic  nerve  function  is  assessed  by  looking  for  dry  skin  especially  on  the  palms  of  the 
hands  or  the  soles  of  the  feet.  Finding  dry  palms  and  soles  of  feet  implies  loss  of  autonomic 
nerve function. 

  Sensory nerve function is assessed by carrying out sensory testing (ST) of the eyes, hands 

and feet as follows: 

  Eyes:  Observe  the  eyelids  for  blinking.  If  the  patient  is  blinking,  assume  that  the 
corneal  sensation  is  normal.  If  the  patient  does  not  blink,  record  “spontaneous  blink 
absent” and refer the patient to the eye clinic.

  Hands and feet: Sensory testing on palms and soles should be done with a ballpoint 
pen on 10 standard points as indicated on the Leprosy Record Card. The procedure for 
sensory testing is described in Figure 3.2 below. 

Figure 3.2 Procedure for sensory testing (ST) of hands and feet 

1. 

Mark any wounds, open cracks, clawing of digits and bone loss or absorption on 
the Leprosy Record Card. 

2.  Support the patient’s hand or foot to prevent any 

                       joint movements in fingers/toes during the test. 

3.  Then  touch  the  skin  very  gently  denting  it  as  little  as 
possible, about 1 mm. The dots on the hand and foot maps 
on the Leprosy Record Card show you where to touch. 
First test while patients are watching and ask them to point 
with  one  finger  wherever  they  feel  a  touch,  to  the  exact 
place touched. When patients understand the test well and 
are pointing clearly, ask someone to screen off their eyes or 
ask them to close their eyes and turn away.  

Each time that you dent the skin record on the hand or foot map on the Patient Record 
Card. Record √ (tick) at the place if the patients feel and point within 3 cm and X if they 
do not feel anything or point somewhere else. 

  Motor  nerve  function:  The  motor  function  of  peripheral  nerves  is  assessed  through 
voluntary  muscle  testing  (VMT).  All  muscle  movements  should  be  assessed  for

range and the strength against the resistance of your hand.  Muscle strength should be 
graded  as  Strong  (S),  Weak  (W)  or  Paralyzed  (P).  Test  the  muscle  strength  of  eyes, 
hands and feet as follows: 

 Procedure for Voluntary muscle testing (VMT) of eye 

Eye closure: [Facial nerve function] 
Ask  patients  to  close  their  eyes  lightly  as  in  sleep.  Observe  whether  or  not  the  closure  is  complete. 
Inability to fully close the eye is termed lagophthalmos. If there is lagophthalmos, measure the lid gap. 
The  lid  gap  is  recorded  in  millimetres.  A  lid  gap  of  more  than  5  mm  necessitates  immediate  action  to 
prevent damage. If closure is normal, record “0 mm”. Then ask patients to close their eyes firmly while 
you gently check for strength. Is the closure S, W or P?

Ask patients to move their little finger all the way in (touching the side of the ring finger) and all the 
way out. Is the movement full?     
If the movement is full, ask patients to hold their little finger out fully while you apply resistance to the 
outward movement at the base of the finger by pushing it in. Record the findings as S, W or P. 
Thumb up: [Median nerve function]                              
Ask patients to bring the thumb up and in front of the index finger but as far away from it as possible. 
Focus  attention  on  the  movements  at  the  base  of  the  thumb  rather  than  the  tip.  Can  they  achieve  this 
testing position? Is the movement full?    
To test the strength of this movement, instruct patients to maintain the starting position while you push 
downwards towards the index finger. Record the findings as S, W or P 
Foot up; [Peroneal nerve function] 
Ask patients to fully lift their foot up towards the shin (dorsiflexion). Check if the movement is full (no 
more movement possible at the ankle joint).                                                                                                                                                    
To test the strength in the testing position, apply resistance to the top of the foot by pushing down. 
Record the findings as S, W or P. 

III. Examination of other organs 

Examination of other organs is important in cases of MB leprosy. 
i) Examination of the eye 
The  eyes  should  be  examined  carefully  under  good  light,  preferably  daylight.  Besides  the  changes 
examined under VMT above, other aspects to be checked include: 
  Loss of eyebrows 
  Corneas for clearness, ulcers or scars 
  Conjunctiva  for  redness  indicating  infection,  such  as  conjunctivitis  (peripheral  redness)  or 

iridocyclitis (redness around the cornea) 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        111 

 
 
 
  Pupils for regular and round shape. Also check reaction to light and look for signs of cataracts 
  Eyeball pressure for glaucoma 
  Vision by asking the patient to count fingers as in Figure 3.3

Figure 3.3 Vision testing 
A patient who cannot count fingers at 6 meters has severe visual impairment. 

ii) Examination of the nose, tongue and gums, throat, breasts and testes 
These organs can also be affected. They should be examined and, in case of doubt, the patients should 
be referred to leprosy referral centers. 

IV. Examination of the skin smear 
A skin smear is a test in which a sample of material is collected from a tiny cut in the skin and stained 
for Mycobacterium leprae.  
The purpose of taking a skin smear is usually to: 

  Confirm the diagnosis of skin smear-positive MB leprosy in a suspect 
  Help to diagnose MB relapse in a patient who has been previously treated 
  Help with the classification of new patients 

Only 1 slide, with smears taken from 2 sites must be collected and examined. The basic field guidelines 
for selection of skin smear sites and steps for taking skin smears are included in Annex 7. The technique 
for collecting and examining skin  smears is  described in  the  ILEP  Learning Guide Three:  How to do a 
skin  smear  for  leprosy.  Skin  smear  services  are  available  in  the  National  TB  Reference  Laboratory 
(NTRL),  Lira  Regional  Referral  Hospital,  and  Buluba,  Kagando,  Kuluva  and  Kumi  hospitals.    One 
positive smear result is diagnostic for MB leprosy.

When the diagnosis of leprosy is certain:

  Carefully  record  all  information  on  skin,  nerves,  hands,  feet  and  other  organs  on  the  Leprosy 

Record Card. 

  Fill in all of the information asked for at the start of treatment as baseline information. 
  After each review examination, record every change in findings on the same card. 

If leprosy is suspected, but the diagnosis is not certain: 

  Patients should be labeled as “suspects” 
  Educate them about symptoms and signs of leprosy and either: 

o  Refer to the next level facility; 
o  Consider the possibility of another skin disease and treat appropriately; or 
o  Wait three months and review the skin lesions again.  

If it is leprosy, loss of sensation may now be observed. If there is no loss of sensation in the skin lesions 
and  no  enlarged  nerves,  but  there  are  suspicious  signs  such  as  nodules  or  swellings  on  the  face  or 
earlobes,  or  infiltration  of  the  skin,  it  is  important  to  try  and  get  a  skin  smear  examination  done.  A 
positive  skin  smear  confirms  the  diagnosis  of  leprosy  while  a  negative  result  (in  the  absence  of  other 
cardinal sign) would rule out leprosy.  

3.2.3.5 Differential diagnosis of leprosy 

      Leprosy  can  be  easily  mistaken  for  a  number  of  skin  diseases.  If  patients  are  examined  carefully, 
mistakes in diagnosis should not occur as none of the cardinal signs of leprosy are found in the common 
skin diseases such as:  

  Birthmarks:  Lightly  or  deeply  pigmented  areas  of  different  sizes  that  have  been  present  since 

birth or soon after birth and do not change. 

  Post-inflammatory  hypopigmentation:  The  skin  may  become  temporarily  or  permanently 
hypopigmented at the end of treatment of several inflammatory skin conditions. It also can follow 
the deliberate application of skin-lightening products for cosmetic reasons. This can be ruled out 
through appropriate history taking. 

  Tinea  versicolor:    These  lesions  often  itch.  They  are  hypopigmented,  but  with  no  loss  of 
sensation.  Usually  they  clear  up  within  six  weeks  with  application  of  antifungal  ointment  or 
cream. 

  Tinea  corporis  (ringworm):  Lesions  are  well-defined  areas  of  hypopigmentation  with  white 
scales  and  without  loss  of  sensation.  Usually,  they  clear  within  six  weeks  of  application  of 
antifungal ointment. 

  Vitiligo:  a  chronic  skin  condition  characterized  by  portions  of  the  skin  losing  their  pigment  

causing whitish patches of different sizes and shapes  often with no clear cause. 

  Pityriasis  alba:  Present  most  commonly  on  the  face,  but  the  upper  trunk  may  be  affected. 
Hypopigmented  rounded  or  oval  patches,  variable  in  size  and  with  the  margin  sharply 
demarcated,  covered  with  fine  adherent  scales.  Often  patients  only  present  with  the  final 
hypopigmentation. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        113 

 
 
  Psoriasis: Raised areas with white fatty scales that bleed easily on scratching (test for pin point 

bleeding). 

  Molluscum contagiosum: Nodular lesions with a depression in the center. Firm squeezing results 

in the appearance of a creamy substance. 

  Onchocerciasis  (in  endemic  areas):  Previous  complaints  of  intense  itching.    There  are  itchy 
nodules and scratch marks. Hypopigmented macules may be one of the manifestations. There is 
loss  of  sensation.  In  a  later  stage,  there  are  mottled  lesions  particularly  on  the  loins  and  shins. 
Skin smears are negative for AFB. 

  Neurofibromatosis:  Multiple  deeply  pigmented  soft  nodules  that  do  not  itch.  Skin  smears  are 

negative for AFB. 

  Syphilis:  Secondary  syphilis  presents  with  a  considerable  variety  of  lesions,  e.g.  papular  and 
nodular lesions. Skin smears are negative for AFB. Serological tests for syphilis will be positive. 
  Kaposi  sarcoma:  In  HIV-positive  patients  and  others,  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  often  presents  with 
nodules on the face and ear lobes. There are often lesions within the mouth and the throat, which 
may bleed. Skin smears are negative for AFB. 

3.2.4 Classification of Leprosy 
It is important to classify the type of leprosy the patient has because it determines the treatment regimen 
and the appropriate messages to give to the patient before administration of treatment. 

In relation to this, there are two treatment groups: 

I.  Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy   
These are patients who have up to five skin lesions in total. These patients should also be skin 
smear-negative. This group of patients is likely to have high body resistance to leprosy bacilli.  
II. Multibacillary (MB) leprosy  
These patients have six or more skin lesions. All leprosy patients with a positive skin smear must 
be  classified  as  MB,  irrespective  of  the  number  of  skin  lesions.  The  bacilli  infecting  an 
individual  with  very  low  body  resistance  will  multiply  freely  in  the  body,  and  the  person  will 
develop MB leprosy, the more severe form of the disease.  

If there is doubt about the classification, the patient should be classified and treated as MB leprosy 

Box 3.3  Key messages for newly diagnosed leprosy patients  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        114 

 
 
When patients are newly diagnosed with leprosy, they should receive help and counseling so that the disease can 
be treated quickly and in the best possible way. The following categories of messages should be given to patients 
(not necessarily at the same sitting):  

  General information 

o  People affected by leprosy should continue to live a normal life.  
o  Leprosy is caused by a germ and is curable. 
o  Explain where to get answers to any questions regarding leprosy. 
o  Consultation and treatment are free of charge.  
o  Discuss how frequently the person should attend the clinic. 
o  Persons who have been in close contact with patients, particularly those living in the same 

household, need to be examined at the earliest opportunity. 

 

Information about treatment 
o  Leprosy is curable. 
o  Leprosy is no longer infectious once treatment has begun. 
o  The treatment lasts 6-12 months depending on the leprosy type. 
o  Tablets must be taken every day at home. 
o  A new blister pack is needed every 28 days. 
o  Common side-effects include reddening of the urine and darkening of the skin. 
o  The skin patches may take time to disappear. 

  Complications called “reactions” may occur and can be treated. These can present as follows: 

o  Patches can suddenly become red, swollen, and more clearly visible. 
o  There may be: 

  Pain or numbness in the limbs 
  Weakness of the hands or feet 
  Swelling of hands and feet 
  Eye problems such as redness, pain, or impairment of vision 

  Disabilities 

o  New disabilities can occur at any time, but they can be managed. 
o  Existing disabilities may or may not improve with treatment. 
o  When problems occur, treatment may be available locally, or the patient may have to be referred 

to another clinic for specialist care. 

o  Various new skills will have to be learnt to prevent and manage disability. 

3.3 TREATMENT OF LEPROSY 

The aims of leprosy treatment are to: 

  Cure the leprosy. 
  Prevent the occurrence of disabilities. 
  Prevent relapse and the development of drug-resistant leprosy. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        115 

 
 
 
 
  Reduce transmission. 

It is provided as 28-day blister packs. 

  MDT is a safe and effective oral treatment of leprosy. 
 
  The intake of the monthly treatment containing rifampicin should be supervised. 
  There are different blister packs by age category for PB and MB leprosy patients. 
  The total duration of treatment is six months for PB leprosy and 12 months for MB 

leprosy. 

  Relapses after MDT are very rare. 

3.3.1 Multidrug Therapy  

MDT  is  a  combination  of  drugs  that  is  very  safe  and  effective  in  treating  leprosy  to  prevent  the 
emergence of drug resistance. Leprosy patients should never be treated with a single drug. 

Important information: 

  MDT is distributed free of charge to all those who need it. 
  The  drugs  are  all  taken  orally.  The  daily  drugs  should  be  taken  in  a  single  dose  on  an  empty 

stomach. 

  The drugs are given out in blister packs that provide four weeks of treatment (1 month). 
  There are different packs with the same drugs but in smaller doses for children. 
  MDT is safe for women and their babies during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 
  MDT can be given to HIV-positive patients, those on antiretroviral treatment, and to patients on 
treatment  for  TB.  If  a  leprosy  patient  is  on  treatment  for  TB,  the  MDT  regimen  should  omit 
rifampicin as long as the TB regimen contains rifampicin.  

3.3.2 MDT regimens  
The standard adult treatment regimen for MB leprosy is: 

Rifampicin:  600 mg once a month                                          
Clofazimine   300 mg once a month and 50 mg daily 
Dapsone: 

100 mg daily. 

Duration: 12 months (12 blister packs) 

The standard adult treatment regimen for PB leprosy is: 

Rifampicin:  600 mg once a month 
Dapsone: 

100 mg daily 

Duration: 6 months (6 blister packs) 

The standard child (10–14 years old) treatment regimen for MB leprosy is: 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        116 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rifampicin:  450 mg once a month 
Clofazimine:  150 mg once a month and 50 mg every other day 
Dapsone: 

50 mg daily  

Duration 12 months (12 blister packs) 

The standard child (10–14 years old) treatment regimen for PB leprosy is:  

Rifampicin:  450 mg once a month 
Dapsone: 

50 mg daily 

Duration: 6 months (6 blister packs) 

PB patients are given two drugs for six months, while MB patients are given three drugs for 12 months. 
Every effort must be taken to ensure regularity of drug intake, so that PB patients complete their treatment 
in six months and MB cases in 12 months. 

Specific blister packs are available for MB and PB leprosy, for adults and children. 

The  health  worker  or  other  accompanying  person  (if  the  health  worker  is  not  available)  should  see  the 
patient take the monthly dose of treatment. This helps to guarantee that the treatment is taken properly as 
a measure to prevent drug resistance. It also gives the health worker an opportunity to check the patient 
for any complications of leprosy. 

3.3.3 MDT for children under 10 years of age 

The  appropriate  dose  for  children  under  10  years  of  age  can  be  decided  on  the  basis  of  body  weight. 
[Rifampicin: 10mg/kg body  weight; clofazimine: 1 mg/kg  body weight  daily  and 6 mg/kg body  weight 
monthly; dapsone: 2mg/kg body weight daily].  

The standard child blister pack may be broken up so that the appropriate dose is given to children under 
10 years of age. Clofazimine can be spaced out as required in consultation with the DTLS. 

3.3.4 MDT for MB patients with a very high bacterial index 

Rarely, it may be considered advisable to treat  a patient with an average bacterial index (BI) of  four or 
more  for  more  than  12  months.  This  decision  may  only  be  taken  by  the  Regional  TB/Leprosy  Focal 
Person  or  specialists  at  referral  units,  after  careful  consideration  of  the  clinical  and  bacteriological 
evidence. 

 3.3.5 MDT for leprosy patients who are co-infected with HIV 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        117 

 
 
 
 
 
For  any  leprosy  patients  who  are  co-infected  with  HIV  and  are  receiving  cotrimoxazole  preventive 
treatment  (CPT),  dapsone  should  be  stopped.  In  PB  patients,  dapsone  should  be  substituted  with 
clofazimine  for  six  months  in  the  same  dosage  as  used  in  the  standard  MDT  for  MB  leprosy.  For  MB 
patients, no further modification of the MDT regimen is required. 

3.3.6 Procedure for administering MDT 

For patients to be treated with MDT, carry out the following steps: 
  Determine which type of MDT is required, PB or MB. 
  Fill in the Patient Record Card, the Leprosy Unit Register and the Patient’s Identity Card. 
  Counsel the patient (and the caregiver, if patient is a child).  
  Directly observe first dose of treatment and explain how to continue the treatment at home. 

The drugs administered once a month should be directly observed, the health worker should make sure that the 
drugs have actually been swallowed. The taking of the supervised dose is most conveniently arranged by having 
the patient attend the clinic each month. This monthly visit is also useful for monitoring the regularity of 
treatment and for identifying complications at an early stage. The other drugs are taken at home. 

MDT is safe, and serious side-effects are very rare. Common side-effects are summarized in table 3.1

Note:  Other  drugs  e.g.  Minocycline,  Ofloxacin  and  Moxifloxacin  can  be  used  if  one  or  more  of  the 
standard drugs have been stopped, however, the determination of appropriate regimens and supervision 
of treatment should be undertaken by specialists. 

3.3.6 How to ensure that treatment is taken regularly 

  Patients should be treated with respect. 
  Take time to explain the illness and its treatment to each patient. 
  Make sure patients understand how to take the treatment and the date of their next clinic visit. 
  Make sure there is a good supply of medicines ready for your patients to take. 
  Listen to patients’ concerns and answer their questions. 
  With the consent of the patient, identify and engage another person (family member or other) as 

treatment supporter. 

  Record the treatment given on the Patient’s Identity Card, the Leprosy Record Card, and the Unit 

Leprosy Register. 

  The DTLS should check those documents regularly to make sure that all patients are taking their 

treatment regularly. 

3.3.7 Management of patients who miss scheduled clinic visits 

As soon as patients miss an MDT appointment, action should be taken by the treatment facility staff to 
find  out  the  reason  and  to  remind  them  to  attend  the  clinic  regularly.  This  is  facilitated  by  recording 
mobile telephone contacts for patients at the start of treatment. If this proves insufficient, a home visit by 
a local community worker should be arranged (preferably within the first month following the date of the 
missed visit). 

If patients have difficulty attending the clinic, it is possible to give them two blister packs at once, but in 
such cases a treatment supporter (community volunteer, family member, or neighbor) should be involved 
in  helping  the  patients  to  continue  the  treatment  at  home  and  reporting  to  the  clinic  in  case  of  any 
problem. 
Patients may miss scheduled clinic visits for reasons such as: 

  Poor accessibility of the clinic (long distance, difficult terrain, or inconvenient timing). 
  Difficulty in getting time off at work. 
  Being overwhelmed with demands or effects of other health problems. 
  Nomadic life style. 
  Lack of understanding of the disease and the need for regular treatment. 
  Stigma. 
  A poor relationship with the health worker. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        119 

 
3.3.8 How to care for patient at follow up visits 

Every time patients come to take their drugs they should: 

  Be asked if there have been any problems since the last visit 
  Be re-examined including carrying out nerve function assessment. 
  Have the attendance recorded in the patient’s card and the unit leprosy register. 
  Be informed about the remaining MDT doses and the date of their next visit. 
  Have the date of the next clinic visit recorded in the patients’ identity card. 

3.3.9 Management of patients who have completed MDT 

When  the  patient  has  completed  six  months  of  treatment  for  PB  leprosy  or  12  months  for  MB  leprosy, 
document in the unit register that the patient has completed the treatment under the heading “Treatment 
Outcome.”  Record  any  residual  signs  in  the  patient’s  record  card  and  issue  certificate  for  treatment 
completion.  
Although patients who have completed MDT are cured, some signs of leprosy may remain: 

  Skin patches caused by leprosy may not disappear immediately or may remain permanently. 
  Loss of feeling, muscle weakness, and other nerve damage may also remain. 

These residual signs should be recorded on the Leprosy Record Card at the time of stopping MDT. 

The  patient  should  be  counseled  on  the  following  issues  and  asked  to  return  to  the  clinic  for  review  at 
least once a year or at any time when any of the previous symptoms recur. 

  Significance of the remaining patches. 
  Essential actions to take in order to prevent further damage. 
  Signs and symptoms of reactions that can occur after MDT. 

When patients return with a leprosy reaction after completing a full dose of MDT, only the reaction should be 
treated. This is not a reason to re-start MDT. 

3.3.10 Loss to follow up   

Every  effort  must  be  made  to  ensure  that  PB  patients  complete  their  treatment  in  six  months  and  MB 
patients in 12 months. When that is not possible, the treatment regimen for PB leprosy must be completed 
within  a  maximum  period  of  nine  months.  The  treatment  regimen  for  MB  leprosy  must  be  completed 
within a maximum period of 18 months. 

Whenever  a  PB  patient  has  missed  more  than  three  months  of  treatment,  or  an  MB  patient  has  missed 
more than six months, it is not possible for them to complete the regimen in the maximum time allowed, 
and  they  should  be  declared  lost  to  follow  up.  This  should  be  indicated  in  the  Unit  Leprosy  Register 
under the heading “Treatment Outcome.” 

A patient who fails to complete treatment within the maximum allowed timeframe is regarded as lost to follow up. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        120 

 
 
 
 
 
Patients returning after loss to follow up should be examined and the findings recorded in the same way as 
for new cases. Returning patients should be managed as follows: 

  Count the number of lesions to confirm the original classification. 
  Reclassify  as  PB  or  MB  according  to  the  number  of  lesions,  register  the  patient  under  category 

“Treatment after Default” and treat with a full course of MDT. 
If there are signs of reaction, manage appropriately.  

 
  Remember that a reaction can be mistaken for a return of the disease. 

A  patient  who  either  remains  very  irregular  on  treatment  or  is  repeatedly  lost  to  follow  up  should  be 
referred to the district leprosy diagnostic/treatment facility. 

3.3.11 Relapse                                                                                                                                                     

Relapse in leprosy is defined as the re-occurrence of the disease at any time after the completion of a full 
course  of  treatment  with  WHO-recommended  MDT.  Relapse  after  MDT  is  rare.    It  is  important  to 
continue vigilance because some sporadic cases of relapse due to drug resistance have been reported. 

Signs of a relapse  

  The appearance of definite new lesions.  
  An increase in the skin smear BI of two or more units at any single site compared to BI taken from 
the same site at the previous examination. Care should be taken to exclude patients suffering from 
leprosy reactions. 

  MB patients who start MDT with an average BI of four or more are more likely to suffer a relapse 
later; most relapses occur long after the treatment was given (sometimes more than 10 years later). 
It can be difficult to distinguish relapses from reactions. Table 3.2 provides guidelines for distinguishing.

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        121 

 
 
Management of relapse cases 
Suspected  relapse  cases  should  be  referred  to  the  Regional  TB/Leprosy  Focal  Person  or  one  of  the 
leprosy referral centers. Skin smear examinations should be performed on all such cases. Relapse cases 
should be retreated with the same MDT regimen.  
3.3.12 Prevention of leprosy 

  At the moment the most important preventive measure against leprosy is early diagnosis of cases 

and treatment. 

  Screening  of  contacts  of  known patients  provides  the  opportunity  for  early  diagnosis  of  cases 
among them. The programmatic implementation of chemoprophylaxis of contacts without leprosy 
disease is under investigation. 

  BCG vaccination: Several studies have demonstrated protection against both PB and MB leprosy 
by BCG even though the observed protection has varied between study populations from 20% to 
80%.   In Uganda  BCG is routinely  given to  newborns for its  protection against severe forms of 
TB. 

3.4 COMPLICATIONS OF LEPROSY AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

  Complications of leprosy include leprosy reactions, effects of nerve damage, complications of advanced 

disease, and psychosocial problems. 

  Leprosy reactions due to associated inflammation can lead to severe nerve injury, impairments, and 

disabilities. 

  The main-stay of treatment of severe leprosy reactions is corticosteroids.  
  Leprosy can cause impairment of vision or even blindness due to damage to the cornea or internal 

structures of the eye. 

3.4.1 Leprosy reactions 

A reaction is the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of inflammation in the skin lesions and /or 
nerves of a person with leprosy. There is pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes tenderness of the skin 
lesions. New skin lesions may appear. There may also be swelling, pain, and tenderness of nerves often 
accompanied by loss of function.  

Please note: 
Sometimes impairment of nerve function occurs without other signs of inflammation, making it less 
obvious. This is called “silent neuritis.” 

Any type of leprosy may show a reaction, but the nature of the reaction differs according to the leprosy 
type. Reactions can occur before, during, or after completion of MDT. 

There are two types of reactions: 

  Reversal reaction or type 1 reaction 
  Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or type 2 reaction 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        122 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apart from PB patients with single lesions, most other patients have some risk of experiencing reversal 
reactions.  Only a small group of MB patients with a high load of bacilli are at risk of developing ENL 
reaction. 

Both types can be divided into mild or severe; severe reactions require treatment with corticosteroids. 

Signs of severe reversal reaction 

If any of the following signs is found, the reaction should be treated as severe: 

  Loss of nerve function, that is, loss of sensation or muscle weakness. 
  Pain or tenderness in one or more nerves. 
  Silent neuritis. 
  A red, swollen skin patch on the face, or overlying another major nerve 

trunk. 

  A skin lesion anywhere that becomes ulcerated. 
  Marked edema of the hands, feet, or face. 

Signs of severe ENL reaction 

If any of the following signs is found, the reaction should be treated as severe: 

  Pain or tenderness in one or more nerves, with or without loss of function. 
  Ulceration of ENL nodules. 
  Pain and/or redness of the eyes, with or without loss of visual acuity. 
  Painful swelling of the testes (orchitis) or of the fingers (dactylitis). 
  Marked arthritis or lymphadenitis. 

Table:---Signs of a severe ENL reaction 

3.4.2 Management of reactions 

All  patients  who  develop  reactions  while  on  MDT  should  have  continue  MDT  without  alteration  of 
dosage. 

Both  types  of  reactions  can  be  precipitated  or  their  response  to  treatment  adversely  affected  by  other 
concurrent conditions, including malaria, intestinal worms, or tuberculosis.  Patients should be carefully 
screened for these and appropriate treatment should be given. 

Mild reactions 
Patients  not  showing  any  of  the  signs  of  severity  listed  in  the  box  above  may  be  managed  at  the 
treatment  center  symptomatically  with  aspirin.  If,  after  1  week’s  treatment,  there  is  no  apparent 
improvement, patients should be managed as having severe reaction.

Severe reactions 
Patients with severe reactions must be referred to the regional referral level where they can be treated 
and monitored effectively. Recent loss of function (within the last six months) in one or more peripheral 
nerves is the main reason for steroids to be prescribed in leprosy. Nerve function should be monitored 
on a regular basis following the recommendations in section 3.2.2.4.  

Severe reversal reactions 
Those should be treated with a course of prednisolone usually lasting 12 -24 weeks. Prednisolone should 
be prescribed by a person properly trained in using it.

Because of the prolonged treatment with the prednisolone, patients must be monitored for potential side-
effects  such  as  peptic  ulceration,  osteoporosis,  diabetes  mellitus,  cataracts,  and  exacerbation  of  latent 
infections like TB. 
As  soon  as  nerve  tenderness  decreases,  patients  with  muscle  weakness  or  paralysis  should  be  taught 
exercises to strengthen the affected muscles and prevent joint stiffness.

Management of severe ENL reactions 
ENL  reactions  are  complex  medical  problems  requiring  careful  management  by  experienced  clinicians. 
Short courses of prednisolone are often used. 
Patients should be treated with prednisolone starting with 60 mg as a single daily dose. After a few days 
the dose can be lowered and, in general, the prednisolone can be stopped after a period not exceeding four 
weeks. The patient’s condition should be assessed before the dose of prednisolone is decreased. 
In patients with recurrent attacks of ENL or those on prolonged treatment of corticosteroids, clofazimine 
should be started and prednisolone gradually withdrawn.  It is important to ensure that the patient has no 
worm infestation, especially strongyloides, before giving high doses of prednisolone. Immune suppression 
can cause dissemination of strongyloides. 

3.4.3 Complications of advanced disease 

3.4.3.1 Eye complications 
Leprosy can lead to blindness following damage to the cornea or due to damage to the internal structures 
of the eye. Patients who report decreased vision or who have red or painful eyes should be referred to 
the Ophthalmology Clinical Officer or other eye specialist.   

 

 Lagophthalmos 
Patients with blink inefficiency should: 
o  Inspect  their  eyes  daily  for  redness  and  foreign  bodies  by  looking  through  a  mirror  or 

asking a neighbor to look. 

o  Learn to blink with effort so that their eyeballs roll up, even if their lids do not close. 
o  If possible, use sunglasses to help to protect them from dust. 
o  Apply artificial tears or ointment without injuring the eye. 
o  Keep dirty fingers and flies away. 
In cases of severe lagophthalmos, where part of the cornea remains exposed even on forced 
closure,  patients  need  surgical  treatment  and  should  be  referred  to  the  nearest  unit  where 
such services are available. 

  Eye infections and corneal ulcer 

 

These  should  be  treated  with  antibiotic  eye  drops  or  ointment  (e.g.  chloramphenicol  or 
tetracycline) to be applied  four times a day. Those with corneal ulcer should be referred to 
hospital.  
 Iridocyclitis (Uveitis) 
Signs of iridocyclitis include red painful eyes, photophobia, diminished vision, and flood of 
tears. Patients with these symptoms should be referred to hospital immediately.  
Chronic iridocyclitis is identified from an irregular pupil that does not dilate fully. This can 
lead to secondary glaucoma and blindness. These patients should also be referred to hospital. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        125 

 
 
3.4.3.2 Facial and other deformities 
The  sunken  nose,  loss  of  eyebrows  (madarosis)  and  the  so  called  “leonine”  face  which  used  to  be 
characteristic of untreated MB leprosy are disfigurements that can be associated with severe stigma and 
discrimination. These instances are now rare. They can be corrected with plastic surgery. 

3.4.3.3 Other medical problems 
Longstanding untreated leprosy and chronic ENL reactions lead to medical complications. These patients 
should be referred to appropriate specialists. 

3.4.3.4 Psychosocial problems 
Disabilities, as well as beliefs and prejudices concerning leprosy and its causes, are the main sources of 
psychosocial  problems  in  leprosy  patients.  People  with  leprosy  often  develop  low  self-esteem  and 
depression as a result of the negative attitudes of their family and community. Such negative attitudes are 
also  observed  among  some  religious  leaders  and  health  service  providers,  including  doctors.  People 
suffering from psychosocial problems may need to be referred for counseling or other help. 

3.5 PREVENTION OF DISABILITY (POD) AND SELF-CARE  

  Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of leprosy prevents occurrence of disabilities. 

  The extent of disability at the time of diagnosis should be assessed for every patient. 

  Recent nerve damage can be reversed with corticosteroid treatment. 

  Grading of leprosy-related disability on a scale from 0-2 guides programmatic decisions on 

prevention and management of disabilities. 

  Prevention and management of disabilities among individual patients includes aspects to be 
managed at home, in the nearest health facility, or at higher levels of the referral system.  

3.5.1 Patients at greater risk of nerve damage 

Patients experiencing long delays between the appearance of the first symptoms of leprosy and the start 
of treatment are at greater risk of nerve damage. Early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy prevents the 
occurrence of long-term complications. 
MB  patients  with  impaired  nerve  function  at  diagnosis  should  be  monitored  more  closely.  Nerve 
damage  can  occur  during  MDT  and  after  the  patient  has  completed  MDT.  The  risk  declines  steadily 
over the following three years.

   3.5.2 The effects of nerve damage in leprosy 

Recent nerve damage (present for less than six months) can usually be reversed with the use of steroids. 
Many  patients  present  with  nerve  damage  of  very  long  duration,  from  which  no  further  recovery  is 
expected. 
The  common  physical  problems  resulting  from  nerve  damage  that  affect  people  with  leprosy  are 
described in table 3.4.

3.5.3 Assessment and recording of disabilities 

Disability  is  a  broad  term  covering  any  impairment,  activity  limitation,  or  participation  restriction 
affecting a person. 

3.5.3.1 Disability grading in leprosy 

Every new case of leprosy must be assigned a disability grade that depicts the condition of the patient at 
diagnosis. The grade is on a scale from 0-2. Each eye, hand, and foot is given its own grade,  totaling 6 
grade measurements per person. The highest grade is used as the disability grade of that patient. 
Grade 0 means no disability found. 
Grade 1 means that loss of sensation has been noted in the hand or foot.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        127 

 
 
 
 
This should not be confused with the loss of sensation in a skin patch, which is caused by local damage 
to  the  small  nerves  in  the  skin,  and  not  to  the  main  nerve  trunks.  For  the  eye,  grade  1  means  loss  of 
blinking reflex and/or inability to hold the eyelids closed against moderate force to open them. 
Measuring and recording grade 1 disability is an essential step in preventing damage to the hands and feet 
of people affected by leprosy. It is therefore a key component of quality leprosy services. 

Grade 2 means that visible damage or disability is noted. 
For the eyes, this includes the inability to close the eye fully or obvious redness of the eye. In leprosy, this 
is  typically  caused  by  either  a  corneal  ulcer  or  by  iridocyclitis.  Visual  impairment  or  blindness  is  also 
measured as a disability grade of 2. 

For the hands and feet, visible damage includes wounds, ulcers, shortening of fingers and/or toes, as well 
as deformity due to muscle weakness, such as a foot drop or a claw hand.  

The Eye-Hand-Foot (EHF) score 
The EHF score is the sum of all the individual disability grades for  the eyes, hands, and feet. Since the 
disability grade can be scored as 0, 1, or 2, it follows that the EHF score ranges from 0 to 12. A score of 
12 would indicate grade 2 disability in both eyes, both hands, and both feet. 

Health workers at the health facility should be able to: 

  Determine at minimum grade 1 disability by asking patients about loss of sensation in their 

hands and feet. 

  Look  for  signs  of  visible  disability  (grade  2),  including  wounds  or  ulcers  on  the  hands  or 

feet, or redness of the eye. 
  Record the visible disability. 
  Refer patients to the facility where POD services are provided. 

Health workers at the referral level should be able to: 

  Re-examine the disability status more accurately (refer back to guidelines for nerve function 

assessment). 

  Record the findings accurately in the Leprosy Record Card. 
 

Institute appropriate POD action (Table 3.6) 

3.5.3.2    Care for people with disabilities due to leprosy 
Interventions for disabilities are carried out at the following levels: 

  Home-based care, including those activities that can be done by the person at home. 
  Local health facility.  
  Referral services (requiring the input of specialists). 

 3.5.3.3 Home-based care for patients 
Patients should be taught how to carry out these self-care activities. 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition.                        128 

 
 
 
 
a)  Problems with eye closure 

Inspect the eye in a mirror to check for redness (if no mirror, ask a neighbor to check). 

 
  Learn to blink frequently to keep the eyes moist and exercise the lids. 
  Wear a hat with a large brim and/or sunglasses to prevent dust from getting into the eyes. 
  Use a sheet or mosquito net to cover the head at night. 

b)  Problems with hands and/or feet  

Inspect daily for signs of injury. 

 
  Soak the hand/foot in water for about 30 minutes every day. 
  Use a rough stone to smoothen the dead skin. 
  Apply oil or petroleum jelly when the skin is still wet to prevent the skin from drying out. 
  Use a clean cloth to cover any open wound. 
  Walk as little as possible, and walk slowly. Take frequent rests (foot care). 
 
 

If foot ulcers are present, rest is essential. 
If there is  any muscle weakness,  such  as foot drop, passive stretching and active exercises 
help to prevent contracture and may assist muscle strengthening. 

  Use protective footwear (e.g., microcellular rubber sandals) all the time for insensitive feet 

and protective appliances (e.g., gloves) for insensitive hands.  

3.5.3.4 Local health facility interventions 
The next level of interventions can be carried out in a H/Center III or IV. The health workers should 

  Discuss  the  management  of  their  patients’  disability  problems  with  the  district  supervisor, 

but eventually take over the responsibility for implementing the interventions. 
Instruct and assist the patient in carrying out the relevant home-care activities above. 

 

a) Problems with eye closure 

  Provide artificial tears or any eye ointment (not containing steroids) if the eyes are very dry. 
  Treat conjunctivitis with antibiotics. 
  Refer more serious eye problems to an Ophthalmology Clinical Officer, Ophthalmologist or 

the nearest specialist eye clinic. 

b) Problems with the hand 

  Review  to  assess  the  implementation  of  expected  home-care  activities  and  advise  as 

necessary. 

  Refer, if required. 

c) Problem with the foot 

  Review  to  assess  the  implementation  of  expected  home-care  activities  and  advise  as 

necessary. 

  Take  foot  maps  for  protective  footwear  or  arrange  for  these  to  be  taken  by  the  DTLS  or 

trained community-based rehabilitation worker. 

  Refer, if required.

3.5.4 Interventions conducted at a regional referral centre 

a) Problems with the eyes 

  Management of acute eye problems at eye clinic. 
  Corrective surgery in severe cases of lagophthalmos (with cornea exposed). 
  Cataract surgery (leprosy is not a contraindication to cataract surgery). 

b) Problems with the hand 

Instruction and assistance with adaptation of tools to avoid injury to insensitive hands. 

 
  Removal of thick callus and trim ulcers with a scalpel blade. 
  Splinting of joints in the presence of weakness or contractures. 
  Management of severe infection of hand ulcers. 
  Reconstructive surgery to correct some cases of weakness or claw-hand (as long as the joints 

remain mobile). 

c) Problems of the foot 

  Removal of thick calluses and trimming of ulcers with a scalpel blade. 
  Management of severe infections of foot ulcers. 
  Surgical management of chronic ulcers. 
  Provision of orthopedic appliances, including those for foot drop. 
  Surgical correction of foot drop. 

3.5.4.1 Encouraging people to practice self-care at home 
It is important that individual patients be given self-care instructions that are relevant to their particular 
situation and that they are supported to practice self-care at home. 
Such support may be provided by: 

o  Health workers 
o  Family members 
o  Local community based organizations 
o  Community development extension workers 
o  Self-care groups for people affected by leprosy or living with disabilities from other causes 

3.5.4.2 The value of appropriate footwear for people affected by leprosy                                                                              
The use of appropriate footwear is important for preventing ulceration among people with loss of feeling 
in their feet. The shoes should be locally available, socially acceptable and used whenever patients walk.                                          
The NTLP-recommended footwear for people with loss of sensation in their feet is microcellular rubber 
(MCR) sandals, with a firm under-sole, a soft insole, and heel straps. Velcro straps are preferred to other 
kinds of fastenings. Other shoes meeting the basic criteria can be used. 

  People affected by leprosy ,especially those with disability, have physical, functional 

and social economic rehabilitation needs 

  Health service providers are responsible for identifying such needs and assuring access 

to the appropriate rehabilitation services. 

  The rehabilitation needs of people affected by leprosy should be addressed in by 

services available for all other people using the CBR approach

3.6 REHABILITATION  

3.6.1 What is rehabilitation?       

Rehabilitation is the process of helping an individual achieve the highest level of function, independence, 
and quality of life possible. 

“Rehabilitation includes all measures aimed at reducing the impact of disability on an individual, enabling 
him or her to achieve independence, social integration, a better quality of life, and self-actualization.” UN 
Standard Rules for Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD). 

3.6.2 The role of health workers in rehabilitation 

Whereas health workers and some district supervisors may not have the time or expertise to be involved 
in rehabilitation activities, they are expected to: 

  Be  able  to  identify  physical,  functional,  or  socioeconomic  problems  resulting  from  disability 

among patients under their care. 

  Know about available services for rehabilitation including those providing assistive devices. 
  Know how to refer people to make use of those services. 
  Be  an  advocate  for  ensuring  that  people  affected  by  leprosy  have  access  to  health  care  and 

rehabilitation services in the same way as other people do. 

  Discourage restrictive thoughts and ideas of other health workers.

3.6.3 Community-Based Rehabilitation 

Community-based  rehabilitation (CBR) is  defined as  a strategy within  general  community development 
for the rehabilitation, equalization of opportunities, and social inclusion of all people with disabilities. 

Leprosy  may  lead  to  variety  of  physical,  functional,  and  social  and/or  economic  problems  needing 
different  types  of  physical  and  social  economic  rehabilitation.  To  address  these,  comprehensive 
approaches that maximize benefits for the individual, family and society at large are needed.  

CBR is one such approach. It emphasizes community participation and empowerment of the individuals 
involved. CBR requires the full participation of the clients, their families, and the communities in the 
rehabilitation process. While people with disabilities may need temporary referral to specialized services 
(e.g., for provision of assistive devices or appliances), these should be linked to CBR programs. 

Organizations  of  people  with  disabilities  need  to  be  involved  in  the  planning  and  management  of 
rehabilitation services. 

Persons  affected  by  leprosy  who  are  in  need  of  rehabilitation  should  have  access  to  existing  general 
rehabilitation services. Similarly, any existing leprosy-specific rehabilitation services should be extended 
to people with other disabilities. 

3.6.4 Promoting inclusion of persons affected by leprosy in CBR 

The following actions may assist in formulating a CBR strategy at district level: 

  Develop  a  district  plan  for  community-based  rehabilitation  that  conforms  to  the  national 

policy/plan. 

  Prepare guidelines for mobilizing local resources to provide special services from government and 

non-governmental organizations. 

  Establish a network of services. 
  Develop  the  capacity  of  service  providers  and  mechanisms  to  create  awareness  about  leprosy-

related disabilities among people with disabilities. 

  Promote a team approach for service provision. 
 

Introduce  locally-specific  techniques  to  train  and  develop  skills  and  knowledge  of  people  with 
disabilities and their families. 

  Promote opportunities for educational, functional, and vocational training and job-placements. 
 

Involve people with disabilities and their families in the decision-making process.

3.7 MONITORING OF LEPROSY CONTROL  

  A focused monitoring and evaluation system is required for the continuous assessment of the 

leprosy control status in the district, region, and country. 

  Leprosy control services are monitored based on two main sets of indicators. 

 

In order to gather monitoring information for the leprosy control program, it is essential to use 
additional tools than those of the mainstream HMIS. 

  The quality of monitoring information is determined by the accuracy, completeness,  

and timeliness of data collection especially in the treatment facility. 

3.7.1 Leprosy Control Indicators 

Leprosy control indicators include the following categories: 
  Those for monitoring progress in leprosy control 
  Those for assessing quality of leprosy services 

3.7.1.1   Indicators for measuring progress in leprosy control 
Indicators  for  measuring  progress  include  general  (core)  indicators  and  those  intended  for 
evaluating case-finding activities in particular. They are summarized in Table 3.8. 

  The number of new cases in  the district is used to estimate the amount of MDT required for 
that district during the following year. Depending on the methods used for case detection, the 
annual  figures  over  a  period  of  several  years  will  show  if  there  is  an  increase  or  decrease, 
which  in  turn  indicates  whether  leprosy  control  activities  are  effective.  Calculating  the  case 
detection rate makes it possible to compare one area with another. 

  The number of cases with Grade 2 disabilities detected in a population gives an indication of 

under-detection. 

  The proportion of new cases with Grade 2 disabilities among all new cases detected during the 
year  is  used  to  assess  the  delay  in  diagnosis  as  an  indicator  for  quality  of  case  detection 
activities.  

  The  proportion  of  new  cases  with  Grade  2  disabilities  per  100,000  population  at  national 
level is used to indicate the contribution by leprosy to disability in the general population. 

 

If transmission of leprosy is being reduced in an area, it is expected that the number of child 
leprosy  cases  (below  the  age  of  15)  will  decrease.  This  trend  should  be  monitored  over 
several years. It is also used for estimating the required stock of child MDT blister packs.

133 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The  proportion  of  new  child  cases  with  Grade  2  disabilities  is  a  further  indicator  of  the 

quality of case detection activities. 

  Some  districts  diagnose  leprosy  more  frequently  in  men  than  women,  but  there  is  concern 
that women may have less access to health care in some districts. If a male-to-female ratio of 
higher than 2 is observed, steps should be taken to ensure that women have adequate access 
to diagnostic services. 

  The number and proportion of MB cases among new cases is a useful guide to the cases at 

risk of complications and is used for estimating the required quantities of MDT drugs.

3.7.1.2   Indicators for assessing the quality of leprosy services 

The indicators for quality of leprosy services, summarized in the table below, will be collected at 
regional level: 

  The proportion of new cases that are correctly diagnosed is an indication of the capacity 
of  the  health  system  to  detect  new  cases.  The  Regional  TB/Leprosy  Focal  Person  will 
validate  the  diagnosis  of  at  least  50  percent  of  the  new  cases  reported  in  the  region  or 
make  arrangements  with  a  suitable  other  person  to  do  so.    In  regions  with  less  than  10 
new cases, all new cases should be validated. Validation should be performed within three 
months of starting the patient on MDT. 

  This  exercise  will  help  to  identify  areas  where  additional  training  and/or  supervision  is 

required. 

  The proportion of new patients who complete their treatment on time is an indication of 
how  well  the  leprosy  patients  are  being  served  by  the  health  services.  The  rate  is 
calculated separately for PB and MB patients in a cohort analysis. A cohort is a group of

patients who all started treatment in the same batch (in the same quarter). The total of the 
figures from the four quarters in a year will give the annual report. 

  The  NTLP  Central  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  confirmation  of  reported 

suspected relapse cases and their management. 

  The  proportion  of  patients  who  develop  new  or  additional  disability  during  MDT  is  an 
indicator to measure how well new nerve damage is detected and treated. Information for 
calculating this indicator will be collected using the EHF (eye-hand-foot) score. In order

  The  proportion  of  patients  who  develop  new  or  additional  disability  during  MDT  is  an 
indicator  of  how  well  new  nerve  damage  is  detected  and  treated.  Information  for 
calculating  this  indicator  will  be  collected  using  the  Eye-Hand-Foot  (EHF)  score  which 
should  be  calculated  and  recorded  at  diagnosis  and  then  repeated  at  the  time  when 
treatment is completed.  

Box 3.4 How to calculate leprosy treatment (MDT) completion rate 

For PB completion rate, the cohort will be from the same quarter 1 (one) year ago. 

How to calculate the MDT completion rate 

 

Identify all the PB patients who are new cases in the district register and who started MDT in the reporting quarter 1 

(one) year back. Note this number. 

  From the cohort, count the number who completed treatment within 9 (nine) months of registration 

  The PB treatment completion rate is calculated as follows: 

Number of new PB cases who completed MDT x 100 

Number of new PB cases who started MDT 

For MB completion rate, the cohort will be from the same quarter 2 (two) years ago: 

 

Identify all the MB patients who were new cases in the register and who started MDT in the reporting quarter 2 (two) 

years back. Note this number. 

  From this cohort, count the number who completed treatment within 18 months of registration. 

  The MB treatment completion rate is calculated as follows: 

Number of new MB cases who completed MDT x 100 

Number of new MB cases who started MDT

3.7.2 Monitoring tools for recording and collecting information about leprosy cases 

  LEPROSY RECORD CARD  

Individual patients’ details and those of the household contacts are recorded on these cards.      
The cards are kept in the treatment unit.  

  UNIT LEPROSY REGISTER 

Data about leprosy patients in each treatment unit is recorded. The data is useful for planning 
and  for  calculation  of  indicators.  Instructions  for  completing  the  register  are  printed  in  the 
inside covers of the register. The DTLS is responsible for ensuring that the register is properly 
completed. One unit leprosy register may be used for several years. 

  PATIENT’S CLINIC APPOINTMENT CARD 

Kept  by  every  patient  on  MDT,  this  card  indicates  the  treatment  category,  the  MDT  doses 
received, and the date of the next supervised MDT dose. 

  DISTRICT LEPROSY REGISTER 

The  register  lists  every  patient  receiving  MDT  in  the  district.  For  each  patient,  it  contains  a 
summary  of  the  information  in  the  Unit  Leprosy  Register  apart  from  details  of  the  monthly 
clinic attendance. The information in this register forms the basis for compiling the quarterly 
reports on case-finding and the outcome of leprosy treatment. 
 DISTRICT DISABILITY REGISTER 
Maintained  by  the  DTLS,  this  register  is  a  summary  of  individual  information  about  people 
living with disabilities during and after MDT. 
 QUARTERLY REPORT ON LEPROSY CONTROL 
Completed  quarterly  by  the  DTLS,  this  report  is  a  summary  of  information  in  the  District 
Leprosy  Register.  It  is  important  to  continue  reporting  even  when  there  are  no  patients  on 
MDT (zero reporting). 

 

 

  QUARTERLY REPORT ON TREATMENT OUTCOMES 

Completed  by  the  DTLS,  this  report  summarizes  treatment  outcomes  of  patients  started  on 
MDT 12 and 24 months earlier for PB and MB cohorts respectively. 

  CERTIFICATE OF MDT COMPLETION 

Kept by the patient, this certificate indicates the date when MDT was completed. It is useful 
for making decisions regarding relapse or other complications occurring after MDT.

3.8 ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE DISTRICT MANAGER  

  The greatest expectation of leprosy-affected people and their communities is to receive 

quality services. 

  District-, regional-, and national-level managers must assure availability of such quality 

services through staff capacity-building, mentoring, and supportive supervision. 

3.8.1 Quality Leprosy Services 

Quality is based on: 

  Appropriate training of staff at every level 
  Regular technical support supervision 
  Monitoring of key indicators (see under Table 3.8 above)         

Characteristics of quality leprosy services 
  Accessible to all who need them. 

o 
o 

MDT can be provided at the nearest health unit. 
There are no geographical, economic, or gender barriers. 

  Patient-centered  and  observe  patients’  rights,  including  the  rights  to  timely  and 
appropriate treatment and to privacy and confidentiality. 
  Address each aspect of case management based on solid scientific evidence regarding: 

o 
o 
o 
o 
o 

Diagnosis (timely and accurate with supportive counseling) 
Treatment with MDT (available free of charge and user-friendly) 
Prevention of disability 
Referral for complications 
Maintenance of records 

3.8.2 Content of Training for General Health Facility Staff 
Leprosy  should  be  included  in  the  core  curriculum  of  all  institutions  training  health  workers  in 
Uganda. Training of general health workers should aim at enabling them to do the following: 

  Suspect leprosy and refer to a facility where diagnosis can be made. 
  Correctly diagnose and classify a case of leprosy (clinical staff). 
  Treat a leprosy patient with the appropriate MDT regimen. 
  Manage or refer cases with complications. 
  Maintain a patient’s leprosy record card and unit leprosy register. 
  Keep adequate stocks of drugs for MDT. 
  Provide  appropriate  information  about  leprosy  to  the  patients,  their  families,  and  other 

community members, including importance of contact surveillance. 

  Recognize  patients  in  need  of  rehabilitation  and  refer  them  to  appropriate  services  for 

medical rehabilitation and community-based rehabilitation.

3.8.3 Organization of Support Supervision and Mentorship 

The aim of support supervision is to ensure the following: 

  Technical skills required for leprosy control activities are present. 
  Any obstacles faced by the health facility staff are identified and removed. 
  Plans for future work and improved performance are made. 
  Health workers are supported and motivated in their work. 
  Additional information not available under the routine reporting system is collected and 

analyzed.

GLOSSARY 

Acid-fast bacilli  
                                                bacilli are acid-fast bacilli. 

            Bacilli that hold colour even after washing with acid. Tubercle     

Bacilli  

Rod-shaped bacteria. 

Bacteriological Index (BI)    An index of the bacillary load in the patient. This is expressed on a 

semi-logarithmic scale as given below.  

BI Interpretation 

1+ 1 to 10 bacilli per 100 high power (oil immersion) fields 

2+ 1 to 10 bacilli per 10 high power fields 

3+ 1 to 10 bacilli per high power field 

4+ 10 to 100 bacilli per high power field 

5+ 100 to 1000 bacilli per high power field 

6+ >1000 bacilli per high power field 

Morphological Index (MI)    An index of viability of the bacilli.  

                                                 MI Interpretation 

Solid bacilli are deemed to be viable while fragmented or granular 
bacilli  are  considered  to  be  non-viable.  Two  hundred  discrete 
bacilli are evaluated if possible. The MI is equal to the percentage 
of viable bacilli. Paucibacillary lesions may not be assessable for 
the MI. The MI in untreated multibacillary leprosy usually ranges 
between  25  and  75  and  should  decline  to  0  after  4–6  months  of 
effective chemotherapy. 

 CD4                                    

Specific lymphocytes that  are  destroyed by  HIV.  The number of 
CD4 lymphocytes is reduced in severe HIV infection.

Annex 2: Technique for Collecting Sputum 

General Principles 

  Sputum specimen collected under instruction of a trained medical worker is likely to be of 

a better quality. 

  Sputum  collection  should  be  done  in  an  open  air  space.  If  not,  the  collection  should  be 
done  in  a  well-ventilated  designated  sputum  collection  room.  Patients  are  more  likely  to 
collaborate and cooperate if they are out of sight of other patients. 

  Patients  who  have  been  chewing  food  shortly  before  the  sputum  collection  should  rinse 

their mouths with water before collecting the sputum. 

  For early morning specimen, the patients should collect the sputum before brushing teeth.  

Before instructing patients to collect sputum specimen, the health worker should: 

  Fill in the Sputum Request Form for each patient with all of their identification features, 

as shown in the form. 

  Enter the patient’s record in the Laboratory Register. 
  Write on the side of the sputum container the same number as is written on the forms. 
   Give the patient the specimen bottle. 

Instructing patients to collect sputum specimen 

  Explain to patients  the reasons  for sputum  collection and demonstrate how to  open and 

close the sputum container. 

  Tell  patients  that  no  one  should  be  standing  in  front  of  them  while  they  are  producing 

sputum. 

  The patient opens the sputum collection container. 
  Before collecting sputum, the patient should breathe in deeply and rapidly. This starts the 

coughing. 

  The  patient  then  carefully  puts  the  coughed  out  material  (sputum)  into  the  sputum 
container  without  contaminating  the  outside  of  the  container.    The  amount  of  sputum 
specimen put in the sputum container should be about 5 mls. If the outside of the sputum 
container is soiled, the container should be discarded and collect a fresh sample  

  The patient closes the sputum container and returns it to the laboratory. 

Schedule for collecting two sputum samples 

Day 1: 
  Collect the “on-the-spot” sample as described above 
 
Day 2: 
  Receive early morning sample from the TB suspect 

Instruct the patient how to collect early morning sample (first sputum after waking) 

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition. 

149 

 
 
Instructions for handling sputum samples in the health facility 

The health worker: 

  Receives the sputum specimen and examines it in the laboratory OR  
  Isolates  each  sputum  container  in  a  plastic  bag  and  stores  it  in  a  cool  place,  ready    for 

transportation to where it can be examined 

  Washes hands 
  Ensures  that  the  duration  of  time  between  sputum  collection  and  examination  in  the 

laboratory does not exceed four days 

Annex 3: Logistics 

Estimating anti-TB drug quantity 
The  quantity  of  anti-TB  drugs  required  for  a  health  facility,  district,  or  region  needs  to  be 
calculated accurately. This will ensure that the patients receive their drugs without interruption.  

Regarding anti-TB drugs, the following terms are important: 

Shelf  life:  Shelf  life  is  the  length  of  time  anti-TB  drugs  may  be  stored  in  adequate 
conditions without affecting their usability, safety, purity, or potency. 

Pipeline:  Pipeline  is  defined  as  the  entire  chain  of  transportation  links  through  which  supplies 
move from manufacturer to consumer.

Storage conditions 

Storage  conditions  are  important  in  order  to  maintain  the  potency  of  the  drugs.  The  following 
conditions should be adhered to: 

  Store space/room should be clean, well lit, ventilated, and free of insects and rodents. 
  Store should be protected from floods, pools of water, or damp conditions.  
  Keep fire extinguisher at the main entrance of the store, and train staff to use it in order to 

protect the store from fire. 

  Maintain cold storage or cold chain, where applicable for TB supplies. 
  Limit access of control area to store staff only. 
  Arrange cartons at least 10 cm. (4 in.) off the floor with identification labels visible. 
  Cartons marked (↑) should be stored likewise. 
  Separate and remove expired drugs from usable stock. 
  Arrange drugs to facilitate “first-to-expire, first-out” (FEFO). 

Dispensing 

Anti-TB drugs should be dispensed according to the regimen shown on the patient treatment card. 
After  dispensing  anti-TB  drugs,  the  quantity  of  drugs  dispensed  is  recorded  on  the  TB  drug 
dispensing log form. 

At the end of the month, the quantity of the drugs dispensed by the unit for each day of the month 
is added up to give the quantity dispensed for the whole month – in blister strips, tablets, or vials. 

Stock-taking 

Stock-taking  is  the  process  of  preparing  a  balance  sheet  for  drug  consumption  for  a  specific 
period. This process requires the following steps: 

  Stock  card  review:  In  this  step  the  stock  balance  is  counted  and  quantified  by  writing 
down the quantity of drugs received, issued, and lost during the period of stock-taking. 

  Physical  count:  Next  a  physical  count  of  all  the  anti-TB  drugs  available  in  the  store  is 
carried  out.  A  date  is  set  for  this  purpose,  and  the  exercise  is  conducted  by  a  physical 
count team. After setting the date for the physical count: 

 Update stock cards and ledgers 
 Prepare the store by arranging expiry dates, damages/losses 
 Suspend issuing drugs during the time of the physical count 
 Include receipts of drugs issued that day

Compiling facility report and request for anti-TB drug supply 

i)  Facility Reports 

To complete the facility report, the following parameters need to be filled in: 

  Beginning balance (A) 
  Received during review period (B) 
  Dispensed (C) 
  Losses/adjustments (D) 
  Ending balance from physical count (E) 
Calculated balance (E) =A+B–C+ (–D). This equation should balance. 

ii) Request for anti-TB drug supply 

Request anti-TB drug supply for four months, by adding the quantity consumed over the 
previous  four  months  (total  quantity  dispensed  in  this  report  plus  previous  report) 
subtracted from ending balance from physical count (E), four months’ consumption (F), 
quantity needed = (F–E). 

iii) 

Patient statistics 

Count the number and type of patients treated and recorded in the register and write it in

Distribution/Storage 

An  efficient  system  for  distributing  anti-TB  drugs  must  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  drugs 
reach  the  health  facilities  and  thus  the  patients.  This  requires  a  reliable  transport  system, 
preferably managed by the NTLP Central Unit. The anti-TB drugs must be stored in a safe place. 
The criteria for a good storage place are: 

  Accessible by road throughout the year 
  Water and electricity 
  Telephone or radio call communication 
  Safe from flooding 
  Security protection

Annex 4: Support Supervision 

Supervision  is  helping  people  improve  their  own  work  performance.  Supervisory  visits  are  an 
opportunity  to  provide  feedback  on  the  reports  received  on  the  indicators  of  monitoring  and 
evaluation. Acknowledge areas of good performance and thank the health workers for a job well 
done.  Areas  where  performance  is  lacking  should  be  pointed  out  and  discussed  freely  with  the 
health  workers  at  the  facility.  In  particular,  the  focus  of  discussion  should  be  directed  towards 
learning why the undesirable events occurred and finding solutions. 

Schedule of supervisory visits 

The  NTLP  manager  should  supervise  zonal  supervisors  in  their  respective  zones  at  least  once  a 
year. The ZTLS should make supervisory visits to districts within their zones at least twice a year. 
DTLS  should  visit  hospitals  and  health  center  IVs  at  least  monthly  and  lower-level  facilities  at 
least once a quarter. 

Ways of collecting information during a supervisory visit 

Interview health workers 

 
  Observe interactions between patients and health workers 
 
  Review TB/leprosy treatment cards and registers 
  Visit the laboratory and check working condition of microscopes and availability 

Interview TB/leprosy patients 

of supplies 

  Check the drug store, inventory, storage, and records of TB/leprosy drugs and 

supplies 

Preparation for supervisory visit 

I.  Review  the  quarterly  recording  and  reporting  forms  submitted.  Note  which  of  the 
monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators  have  insufficiencies  (refer  to  indicators  for 
monitoring and evaluation). 
Prioritize the insufficiencies in order of importance. 

II. 
III.  Arrange and obtain requirements – transport, accommodation, meals, per diem, stationery, 

and schedule date and health facility for the supervisory visit. 

IV.  Usual items to check in supervisory visits: 

  The quality and completeness of data on quarterly reports 
  The completeness of smear conversion rates at two (3) months 
  The reported incidence rate and case detection rate for smear-positive cases in the 

health facility, district, or region

  The proportion of PTB sputum smear-positive out of all the PTB patients registered 

in the health facility, district, or region 

  The  proportion  of  PTB  sputum  smear-positive,  PTB  sputum  smear-negative  and 
extra-pulmonary TB out of all TB patients registered in the health facility, district, 
or region 

  Treatment  outcome  for  new  and  retreatment  PTB  sputum  smear-positive  cases  in 

health facility, district, or region 

  Any scheduled training in TB for health facility and laboratory staff of district or 

region 

  Supervisory visits to the health facilities by DTLS 
  Record  of  referral  between  diagnostic  units  and  treatment  units  –  whether  the 
referred  patients  reached  the  laboratory,  their  sputum  specimens  were  examined, 
and results recorded. 

  Anti-TB  and  leprosy  drugs  –  quantity,  expiry  dates,  stock  cards,  dispensing  logs, 
facility report, and request for drugs and buffer stock for health facility, district, or 
region. 

  Check laboratory for reagents, staff, and safety for doing TB microscopy 
  Enquire  about  the  working  linkage  of  SCHW,  treatment  supporters,  and  health 

workers in the facility 

  Check  TB  unit  registers,  TB  laboratory  registers,  and  district  TB  registers  for 

numerical counting, patient classification, and overall completeness  

Conducting supervisory visits 

Using the list of insufficiencies prepared when planning the supervisory visit, discuss these issues 
with the health workers at the facility and the DTLS in order to find the cause of and solution for 
the insufficiencies. The following areas are important: 

Is someone responsible for carrying out a particular task? 
Is the person’s knowledge and skill sufficient for the task? 

 
 
  Has training been provided in this area? 
  Are the staff motivated to perform their work?  
  Are there barriers to performing work correctly?  

At the end of the supervisory visits, present and discuss a summary of the main findings with the 
health workers at the appropriate level and agree on next steps. A copy of the written supervision 
report should be sent to the relevant officers.

Annex 5: Treatment Supporter 

The  treatment  supporter  is  identified  in  the  village  meeting  involving  the  VHT,  LC1,  and 
community members. The role of the treatment supporter is to help the TB patient adhere to taking 
anti-TB drugs. It is recommended that the treatment supporter should: 

a)  be a resident of the community, perhaps a neighbor, family member or other relative; 
b)  have a minimum level of literacy (able to read and write); 
c)  be identified by the community and accepted by the patient; and  
d)  understand and accept the role. 

Note: A TB/HIV co-infected patient who is on both ART and anti-TB medication should have 

the same treatment supporter for both conditions. 

The treatment supporter should live near enough to the patient to carry out the following tasks and 
responsibilities: 

  Observe the patient taking the daily dose of anti-TB drugs correctly. 
  Tally the drug intake day by day on the patient’s treatment card. 
  Ensure uninterrupted availability of drugs. In the rare event that the SCHW is delayed, the 

treatment supporter should collect the drugs from the health facility. 

  Remind  the  patient  to  go  for  sputum  follow-up  examinations  at  two  (3),  five,  and  eight 

months of treatment. 

  Encourage the patient to continue taking treatment. 
  Keep the patient’s drugs safe.  
  Inform the SCHW of any problem related to the health of the patient or to any constraint in 

administering DOT. 

The treatment supporter is therefore responsible to the SCHW and the community.  

Basic facts about TB for the treatment supporter 

  TB is caused by a germ that commonly affects the lungs. 
  TB spreads to others when a TB patient coughs or sneezes. 
  TB can be stopped from spreading by treating and curing the patient. 
  The main symptom of TB is a cough lasting two or more weeks. 
  TB can be cured if the patient takes anti-TB drugs daily for the recommended duration of treatment. 
 
  Spread of TB can be prevented by (i) patients covering their mouths or noses when coughing or 
sneezing, and (ii) opening windows and doors to allow fresh air to flow through the house.  

If TB drugs are not taken for the recommended period, the disease may not be cured.

Annex 6: Tuberculin Skin Testing  

Standard operating procedure for tuberculin skin testing  

Administering the Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test 

Make sure that the area for administering the test has a firm, well-lit surface, and that equipment 
and  supplies  are  ready.  The  Mantoux  tuberculin  skin  test  consists  of  an intradermal  injection  of 
exactly one tenth of a milliliter (mL), which contains 5 tuberculin units.  

Look at the vial label to make sure the vial contains the tuberculin that you want to use, including 
the tuberculin unit strength. The label should indicate the expiration date. If it has been open more 
than  30  days  or  the  expiration  date  has  passed,  the  vial  should  be  thrown  away  and  a  new  vial 
used.  

When you open a new vial, write the date and your initials on the label to indicate when the vial 
was opened and who opened it.  

To  avoid  reducing  the  potency  of  the  tuberculin,  store  it  inside  a  refrigerator  so  that  it  remains 
between 2 and 8 degrees Centigrade. Also store and transport the tuberculin in the dark as much as 
possible and avoid exposure to light.  

On a firm, well-lit surface, expose the patient's arm and slightly flex it at the elbow. The injection 
should be placed on the palm-side-up surface of the forearm, about 2–4 inches below the elbow. 
Your local institutional policy may specify the right or the left forearm for the skin test. The area 
selected should be free of any barriers to placing and reading the skin test such as muscle margins, 
heavy hair, veins, sores, or scars.  

After choosing the injection site, clean the area with an alcohol swab by circling from the center of 
the  site  outward.  Allow  the  site  to  dry  completely  before  the  injection.  Because  some  of  the 
tuberculin solution can adhere to the inside of the plastic syringe, the skin test should be given as 
soon as possible after the syringe is filled. 

Pick up the syringe and be sure to fasten the needle tightly on the syringe by holding the cap and 
twisting it onto the tip of the syringe. Next, remove the needle cap.  

The  needle  bevel  should  be  perpendicular  to  the  flange  of  the  syringe.  If  necessary,  turn  and 
tighten the needle to line up the bevel correctly with the flange.  

Place the vial on a flat surface, hold the vial between the thumb and fingers, and insert the needle 
through the neoprene stopper.  

Invert the vial while keeping a firm hold on the syringe and plunger. The tip of the needle should 
be below the fluid level in the vial.  

Manual for management and control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Uganda, 3rd Edition. 

157 

Pull back on the plunger and draw out slightly more than the one tenth of a milliliter needed for 
the test.  

Remove  the  needle  from  the  vial.  Hold  the  syringe  in  an  upright  position,  and  then  draw  back 
slightly on the plunger. Tap the syringe lightly to break up air bubbles, and then push forward.  

Expel all air and excess fluid from the syringe and needle, leaving exactly one-tenth of a milliliter 
of tuberculin solution in the syringe.  

The  second  step  in  administering  the  Mantoux  tuberculin  skin  test  is  injection.  You'll  inject  the 
tuberculin, discard the needle and syringe, check that the skin test was administered properly, and 
repeat the test if needed.  

Stretch  taut  the  selected  area  of  skin  between  the  thumb  and  forefinger.  For  an  intradermal 
injection,  the  needle  bevel  is  advanced  through  the  epidermis,  the  superficial  layer  of  skin, 
approximately 3 mm so that the entire bevel is covered and lies just under the skin. The injection 
will produce inadequate results if the needle angle is too deep or too shallow.  

When the needle is inserted at the correct angle you can see the bevel of the needle just below the 
skin surface. Next, release the stretched skin and hold the syringe in place on the forearm. Grip the 
flange  of  the  syringe  between  your  first  and  middle  fingers.  Use  your  thumb  to  press  on  the 
plunger.  

Now, slowly inject the tuberculin solution. You should feel fairly firm resistance as the tuberculin 
enters  the  skin.  A  tense,  pale  wheal  that's  6–10  mm  in  diameter  appears  over  the  needle  bevel. 
Remove the needle without pressing or massaging the area.  

Next, discard the used syringe immediately in the designated puncture-resistant container 

Reading the Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test 

To begin,  collect  the following supplies:  a small,  plastic, flexible ruler marked in  millimeters to 
measure the test, a pen to mark the edges of the induration, and an alcohol pad to clean off the pen 
marks. You'll need the tuberculin testing forms for documenting the measurement results. 

The skin  test  should be read between 48 and 72 hours after the skin  test has been administered. 
The basis of reading the skin test is the presence or absence of induration, which is a hard, dense, 
raised formation. This is the area that is measured.

Annex 7: Field Guidelines for Taking Skin Smears for Leprosy 

Selection of sites 

  Only  two  sites  are  smeared:  i)  from  the  center  of  the  most  obvious,  active  skin  lesion 
(usually nodule) in MB cases, and from the edge of the most active patch in PB cases;  
ii) from an ear lobe. 

  If there is no suitable skin lesion, take the second smear from the  other ear lobe or from 

sites where lesions were originally recorded. 

Steps for taking the skin smears 

  Explain the procedure to the patient (and attendant). 
  Wash your hands and put on gloves. 
  Take a clean slide and mark it using a slide marker with laboratory number and date. 
  Clean the slide with methylated spirit. 
  Make a skin fold and squeeze it between thumb and index finger to make it bloodless. 
  Make a cut of 5 millimetres long and 3 mm deep with a sterile disposable scalpel blade, 

meanwhile maintaining the pressure on the skin fold with the fingers. 

  If any blood or tissue fluid discharges, wipe it off with a sterile cotton wool swab. 
  Firmly scrape the cut edge and bottom of the wound with the tip of the blade turned to 90 

degrees. 

  Gently and equally smear the tissue fluid and pulp on the slide in a circular shape with a 

diameter of 5–7 mm. 

  Collect the smears of the two sites on one slide. 
  Dress the small wound. 
  Use a new disposable blade for the next patient. 

Note: This is a skin piercing procedure with the potential risk of transmitting HIV.  The 
procedure should be performed taking all necessary precautions.  

  Details  of  the  procedures  for  taking,  fixing,  staining,  and  reading  skin  smears  are 
included in How to do a skin smear examination for leprosy (ILEP Learning Guide Four, 
2006). Copies can be accessed at the NTLP Central Unit, the leprosy referral centres, and 
online at the ILEP website  http://www.ilep.org.uk
